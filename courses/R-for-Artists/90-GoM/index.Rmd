## Introduction

What is there to not like about maps!!!

We will learn to make static and interactive maps and to show off
different kinds of data on them, data that have an inherently "spatial"
spread or significance!

Trade Routes? Populations? Street Crime hotspots? Theatre and Food
districts and popular Restaurants? Literary Paris, London and Barcelona?

All possible !!
