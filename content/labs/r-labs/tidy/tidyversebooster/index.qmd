## Introduction

I am going to replicate the fantastic tutorial material from [Christian Burkhart]()'s website. It is going to be long, but boy, is it worth it! I expect that thsi tutorial when complete will offer a cookbook when I want to achieve specific things in R, reading, arranging, plotting, graphing, inference, right upto ML, since these tasks are capable of automating and solving so many otherwise knotty problems.

(This is also an atonement of sorts: I had done this two years ago and not saved my file on the cloud.)
