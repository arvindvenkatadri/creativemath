What was Brad Pitt throwing away? He was throwing away the individuality of the measures, subsuming them to one summary. This is a big idea in statistics, and it is called aggregation.

::: {.column width="65%"}

Steven Stigler (2016) in “The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom”:

-   One of the Big Ideas in Statistics is: ***Aggregation***
-   How is it revolutionary? 
- By stipulating that, given a number of observations, [you can actually gain information by throwing information away]{.bg-light-red .black}
-   In taking a simple arithmetic mean, we discard the individuality of the measures, subsuming them to one summary.

In the Sherlock Holmes story, [The Adventure of the Dancing Men](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/108/108-h/108-h.htm#chap03), a criminal known to one of the characters communicates with her using a childish/child-like drawing which looks like this:

How would Holmes decipher this message?

## Sherlock Holmes: The Adventure of the Dancing Men

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Using Conjectures: Symbols -> Letters
  - Holmes deduces that the most common letter in the message is "E"

## What Charts work for counting?
 
| Variable #1 | Variable #2 | Chart Names |              Chart Shape              |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|    Qual    |    None     |  Bar Chart  | {{< iconify ion bar-chart size=4x >}} |

::: {.smaller}
Bar are used to show "counts" and "tallies" with respect to Qual variables. For instance, in a survey, how many people vs Gender? In a Target Audience survey on *Weekly Consumption*, how many low, medium, or high expenditure people?
:::

---

## Where's our Data?

OK,
Let's get some data to count: 

<a href="./data/penguins.csv"><i class="fas fa-save"></i> Penguins Data </a>

And let's for now use a pre-set Workflow in Orange

<a href="./Orange/barchart.ows"><i class="fas fa-save"></i> Barchart Workflow </a>



---

## Workflow#1: Bar Charts

- We will look at the data
- Make a Data dictionary
- Identify the Qual and Quant variables
- Prepare Counts and Bar Charts wrt Qual variables
- In Orange! Point, Click, and See!

---

### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Variables
- `species`: Species of the penguin (Qual)
- `island`: Island where the penguin was observed (Qual)
- `sex`: Male / Female penguin (Qual)
:::

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Variables
- `bill_length_mm`: Length of the penguin's bill in millimeters (Quant)
- `bill_depth_mm`: Depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters (Quant)
- `flipper_length_mm`: Length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters (Quant)
- `body_mass_g`: Mass of the penguin in grams (Quant)

Are there more penguins of some `species` than there are in others?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

tinytheme("classic")
tinyplot::plt(data = penguins, x = ~ species | species,
              type = "barplot", alpha = 0.5,
              main = "Penguin Counts by Species")
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
### Research Question
Are the penguin polulations on different `island` the same?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-height: 7
tinytheme("classic")
tinyplot::plt(data = penguins, x = ~ island | island,
              type = "barplot", alpha = 0.5,
              main = "Penguin Counts by Island",
              xlab = "Island")
```

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

-   Counts first give you an absolute sense of how much data you have.

-   Counts by different Qual variables give you a sense of the **combinations** you have in your data: $(Male/Female) * (Species) * (Island)$ (Say 2 \* 3 \* 3 = 18 combinations in the data)
-   Counts then give an idea whether your data is lop-sided

-   Since the X-axis in bar charts is *Qualitative* (the bars don't touch, remember!) it is possible to sort the bars at will.

## Jack and Rose lived happily ever after?

- Let's get the `titanic` data, using the `Datasets` widget in Orange.

- There were 2201 passengers, as per this dataset.

## {{< iconify tabler variable >}} What kind of Data Variables will we choose?


| Variable #1 | Variable #2 |       Chart Names       |                                            Chart Shape                                            |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
|    Qual     |    Qual     | ~~Pies~~, Mosaic Charts | {{< iconify carbon chart-marimekko size=4x >}} |


Here, $area \sim count$, so the area of the tile is proportional to the count of observations in that tile.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Question #1{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

::: callout-note

What is the dependence of `survived` upon `sex`?
:::

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-sex-survived.png)
:::


::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
- Note the huge imbalance in `survived` with `sex`
- Men have clearly perished in larger numbers than women. 
- Colouring shows large [*positive* residuals]{style="color: blue;"} for men who died, and large [*negative* residuals]{style="color: red;"} for women who died. 

So sadly Jack is far more likely to have died than Rose. 
:::

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Question #2{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

::: callout-note
### How does `survived` depend upon `status`?
:::

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-mosaic-survived-status.png)
:::


::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
- Crew has seen deaths in large numbers, 
  - as seen by the large [*negative* residual]{style="color: red;"} for crew-survivals. 
- [First Class passengers have had speedy access to the boats](https://youtu.be/kQ8WsD9AGX4) and have survived in larger proportions than say second or third class. 
- There is a large [*positive* residual]{style="color: blue;"} for first-class survivals. 
- Rose travelled `first class` and Jack was `third class`. So again the odds are stacked against him. 
:::
:::

## What are these Residuals anyhow?{.smaller}

When differences between the actual and expected counts are large, we deduce that one Qual variable has an effect on the other Qual variable. (speaking counts-wise or ratio-wise)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-height: 12
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Actual Counts"
#|  - "Expected Counts!!"
#|  - "Tile-Wise Differences = Residuals"
data("titanic", package = "ggmosaic")

counts_table <- mosaic::tally(Survived ~ Sex, data = titanic) # No margins added
vcd::mosaic(counts_table,gp = shading_max, 
            main = "Titanic Mosaic Chart")
vcd::mosaic(counts_table, gp = shading_max, type = "expected", main = "Titanic Mosaic Chart, Expected")
vcd::assoc(counts_table, gp = shading_max)

```
