What was Brad Pitt throwing away? He was throwing away the individuality of the measures, subsuming them to one summary. This is a big idea in statistics, and it is called aggregation.

::: {.column width="65%"}

Steven Stigler (2016) in “The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom”:

-   One of the Big Ideas in Statistics is: ***Aggregation***
-   How is it revolutionary? 
- By stipulating that, given a number of observations, [you can actually gain information by throwing information away]{.bg-light-red .black}
-   In taking a simple arithmetic mean, we discard the individuality of the measures, subsuming them to one summary.

In the Sherlock Holmes story, [The Adventure of the Dancing Men](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/108/108-h/108-h.htm#chap03), a criminal known to one of the characters communicates with her using a childish/child-like drawing which looks like this:

## What Charts work for counting?
 
| Variable #1 | Variable #2 | Chart Names |              Chart Shape              |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|    Qual    |    None     |  Bar Chart  | {{< iconify ion bar-chart size=4x >}} |

::: {.smaller}
Bar are used to show "counts" and "tallies" with respect to Qual variables. For instance, in a survey, how many people vs Gender? In a Target Audience survey on *Weekly Consumption*, how many low, medium, or high expenditure people?

## Where's our Data?

OK,
Let's get some data to count: 
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

penguins %>% downloadthis::download_this(output_name = "penguins", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Penguins", button_type = "info", icon = "fa fa-save",   class = "hvr-sweep-to-left")
```

<a href="./data/penguins.csv"><i class="fas fa-save"></i> Penguins Data </a>

And let's for now use a pre-set Workflow in Orange

<a href="./Orange/barchart.ows"><i class="fas fa-save"></i> Barchart Workflow </a>



---

## Workflow#1: Bar Charts

- We will look at the data
- Make a Data dictionary
- Identify the Qual and Quant variables
- Prepare Counts and Bar Charts wrt Qual variables
- In Orange! Point, Click, and See!

---

### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

- `species`: Species of the penguin (Qual)
- `island`: Island where the penguin was observed (Qual)
- `bill_length_mm`: Length of the penguin's bill in millimeters (Quant)
- `bill_depth_mm`: Depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters (Quant)
- `flipper_length_mm`: Length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters (Quant)
- `body_mass_g`: Mass of the penguin in grams (Quant)

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?{.smaller}

-   Always ~~count your chickens~~ count your data before you model or infer!
-   Counts first give you an absolute sense of how much data you have.
-   Counts by different Qual variables give you a sense of the **combinations** you have in your data: $(Male/Female) * (Species) * (Island)$ (Say 2 \* 3 \* 3 = 18 combinations in the data)
-   Counts then give an idea whether your data is lop-sided: do you have too many observations of one category(level) and too few of another category(level) in a given Qual variable?
-   Balance is important in order to draw decent inferences
-   And for ML algorithms, to train them properly.
-   Since the X-axis in bar charts is *Qualitative* (the bars don't touch, remember!) it is possible to sort the bars at will.
