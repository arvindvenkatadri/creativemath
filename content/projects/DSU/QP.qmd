    ## Tasks

    1.  Exploratory data analysis: Explore the dataset using various
        visualization techniques in R / Radiant / Orange (e.g.,
        histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc.). Identify any
        potential outliers, missing data, or other data quality issues.
        Summarize the main characteristics of the dataset.

    2.  Statistical model development: Choose a response variable of
        interest (e.g., wine quality, marketing campaign outcome, iris
        species) and build a linear regression model to predict this
        variable based on the other variables in the dataset. Evaluate
        the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g.,
        mean squared error, R-squared, etc.). Discuss the strengths and
        limitations of the model.

    3.  Basic ML algorithms: Choose a response variable of interest
        (e.g., wine quality, marketing campaign outcome, iris species)
        and build a classification model using a basic ML algorithm in R
        (e.g., decision tree and random forests.). Evaluate the
        performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g.,
        accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.). Discuss the
        strengths and limitations of the model.
