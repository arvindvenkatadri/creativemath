# Introduction

Here we go with another of my *TRIZ Chronicles* ! The earlier editions
are here: [**Lawrence of
Arabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/")

This is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative
Thinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,

This solution to urban "micro-power" generation has won numerous awards,
most notably the [James Dyson Award in
2018](https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/2018/project/o-wind-turbine/). The
inventors are [Nicolas
Orellana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicorellana/) and [Yaseen
Noorani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseen-noorani-b5402a79/?originalSubdomain=uk).

Without further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable
invention.

## A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator

For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"):

-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source
    TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k "Open Source TRIZ on YouTube")**,**
    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation
-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.
-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
    Principles.
-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.

In the video itself, we heard about how electrical power **consumption
centers** are the urban areas and these are far away from the
**generation sites**. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these
costs. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission equipment; we go
to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is already a
*Contradiction*, which we might solve using **Segmentation** to arrive
at *Local Generation of Power*. This leads easily to Solar Panels on
rooftops for example. Again while this *may* be cheaper than the
electrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and
space and is centralized per building Can we take **Segmentation** even
further and think of a *household-based* power generation unit?

What would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around
the home? Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify
the *Parameters* of this Problem:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Cause and Effect Diagram or Fish- bone Sample
library(qcc)
library(SixSigma)

#Effect
effect <- "Hyper Local Wind Power Generation"

#Causes
causes.head <- c("Measurement", "Material", "Methods", "Environment", "Manpower", "Machines")

#Individual Causes
causes <- vector(mode =  "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1] <- list(c("Wind Direction", "Wind Velocity"))

causes[2] <- list(c("Wires","Apartment Walls"))

causes[3] <- list(c("Suspension", "Exposure", "Access", "Maintenance"))

causes[4] <- list(c("Urban", "Buildings", "External Walls"))

causes[5] <- list(c("Residents","Neighbours", "Birds"))
causes[6] <- list(c("Mech Arrangements", "Electrical"))

#Fishbone Diagram
#
ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes, main ="Where is the Wind?",ss.col = c("", "red"), sub = paste("Ishikawa Cause-Effect Diagram \n (Made with R)"))



```

Looking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them
off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up
several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked
some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and
not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that
some these may sound *naive*, but that is way to start!

1.  I would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too
    close to the walls for it to harness the wind.
2.  How to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection
    wires get twisted?
3.  Do I need a
    [Commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric))?
    Won't that be heavy?
4.  What voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my
    230V AC mains?

As you can see, many different problems. Let us cut to the chase and
state perhaps the most interesting problem that the inventors have
solved as demonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an
[**Administrative
Contradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp "https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp")
in *plain English*:

::: callout-note
## Administrative Contradiction

**AC**: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but
winds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.
:::

What would an IFR be in this situation? How "unreasonable" can we be?
Let us try:

::: callout-important
## Ideal Final Result

Torque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)
:::

::: callout-caution
## Unidirectional Assumption

I have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional
movement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to
harness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in
one direction (CW or CCW). AC generation in principle is immune to
direction of rotation.
:::

Let us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in
the [**TRIZ**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)
[**Contradiction**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf "Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003")
[**Matrix(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^1]:

::: callout-note
## Technical Contradictions

-   **TC 1**: Improve `(15)Force/Torque` while not worsening
    `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object`
-   **TC 2**: Improve `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object` while not
    worsening `(15)Force/Torque`
:::

Again we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other
metaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are
`12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object)`, `14(Speed)`, and
`(40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System`.

Is there a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^2] possible here?

::: callout-warning
## Physical Contradiction

The Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In
other words, the rotor must be "soft" and "hard" at the same time.
:::

Let us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ
Inventive Principles.

## Solving the Technical Contradiction

Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix
suggests:

For `TC-1`:

1.  **17(Another Dimension) !!**

2.  **4( Asymmetry)**

3.  **14(Curvature) !!!**

4.  **10(Preliminary Action)**

    and with `TC-2`:

5.  **3(Local Quality)**

6.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**

7.  **35(Parameter Change)**

Hmm...based on the PC, we expected we expected a **Separation in Space**
solution, suggested by Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry.

Viewing these Inventive Principles as we *Generalized Solutions* we try
to map these back into the Problem at hand. I deliberately use many
visual hints here from math, geography, and biology.

1.  **(14)Curvature**: Hmm...nothing new here, or is there? Of course
    the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like....
2.  **17(Another Dimension)**: A near-spherical thing has really only
    one dimension..the radius. Should there be curved changes in radius
    then? Should the radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or
    depressions ( negative change?) How can a bump or a depression
    *itself* be curved? Should the bump be like a welt, and the
    depression like a groove?
3.  **4(Asymmetry)**: The bumps or depressions.....they have to be
    asymmetric? So....not like *longitudes* and nor *latitudes*, in fact
    maybe not even like (great) circles, but arcs.
4.  **3(Local Quality)**: OK, the bumps or depressions are already
    "local"....can we go further? Should there be "fin-like" structures
    on or inside them? How can fins be *asymmetric*, then? By acting
    like miniature flaps or trapdoors, that fall flat when pushed in one
    direction and stand up when pushed in the other direction...somewhat
    like a dog or cat's fur. Then *push* and *pull* work differently.
5.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**: What do we wish to guard against?
    Counter acting wind forces. So the fins or vanes should fall flat
    when pushed on one side and stand up when pushed the other way. Cat
    fur again.

So finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a
spindle, with spiral arc-like depressions at different places on the
surfaces. Within the arc-like depressions are hinged vane-like
structures that collapse in one direction and stand up when pushed the
other way.

## Using TRIZ Separation Principles

As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**
parameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*
for example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.

Our IFR states that we want the rotor to yield one way and to not yield
when pushed the other way so it needs to be both hard and soft at the
same time. This is a Physical Contradiction!

TRIZ offers us a smaller and more easily "memorizable" set of metaphoric
solutions in the form of **Separation Principles** to deal with Physical
Contradictions. Here they are:

-   [Separation in Time]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation in Space]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation on Condition]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation between Parts and the Whole]{.smallcaps}

In this case we can easily see and application of [Separation in
Space]{.smallcaps} and also [Separation on Condition.]{.smallcaps}
However I think in this case, it would not be easy to arrive at the
Solution using just these.

In the next episode of \# TRIZ Chronicles, I wish to step even further
out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think looking at some of
the institution-building ideas in

    Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of
    Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.

    can, then there are a very crisp set of **TRIZ Separation
    Principles** that we can apply to solve the Problem.
