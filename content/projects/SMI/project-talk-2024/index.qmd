## So What are the Challenges? {.smaller}

#### Personnel

# Teaching with Role Play Games

## RPG: Pictures-1

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](../../../materials/images/the-village-fair-gaon-ka-mela-hindi.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/village-fair-1.JPG)
:::
:::

::: aside
-   Buying and Selling
-   Profit and Loss
-   Set, Groups, Taking Common...
:::

## RPG: Pictures-2

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](../../../materials/images/Moon-and-the-cap.png){height="120%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/Kaggalipura-11.jpg)
:::
:::

::: aside
-   Solar System, Eclipses...
-   Time Zones
-   Rotation , Revolution of Planets
:::

## RPG Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
#### Step#1: Book Mining

![](images/Book%20Mining%20Map.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Read the book aloud!
-   Find Characters, Events, Places, Emotions...
-   Document these for each Book in a searchable Excel (Horrors!)
:::
:::

::: aside
-   This was the template for the [BookFace](https://www.facebook.com) Student Review Activity...
:::

## RPG Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
#### Step#2: Curriculum Mining

![](../../../materials/images/MLL-Grouping.png){height="360" width="540"}
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Curriculum is specified in terms of *Minimum Learning Levels* (MLLs)
-   Each Subject, each class
-   Short Crisp phrases or sentences:
    -   Math in real life
    -   Simple Bills
    -   Use Road Signs
    -   Traffic Rules
:::
:::

::: aside
-   About 15 Groups of MLLs
-   Mined about 100 books across all Reading Levels
-   [O&C at SMI](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/teaching/3-order-and-chaos/modules/6b-mangoes/) uses Book Mining (Hamlet, The Three Musketeers.. )
:::

## RPG Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Step3: [Socratic Questions](http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html) to Start

-   Questions(3-4) bring a specific aspect of the book into focus

-   Book Mining shows which aspects to focus on and to develop questions on

-   Allow one to depart from the specifics of book and go more *general*

-   General Ideas can motivate an Activity
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
-   E.g. “The Village Fair” → Things available in a fair → Buy and Sell → Like things unlike things

![](../../../materials/images/the-village-fair-gaon-ka-mela-hindi.jpg){height=70%}

:::
:::

## RPG Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Step4: Create Role-Play-Game

-   Book Mining done earlier + Questions created above
-   Brainstorming, Word-Association Games
-   Clues from Miming and Dumb Charades
-   Using modifications of common childhood games
-   Google News, You Tube videos
-   Public events, News Stories and TV advertisements provide a fertile ground for Activity creation.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Eg: “Grandpa Fish and the Radio” → methods of communication → TV, Radio, Phone, Post, Telegram, Visual Communication Signs

![](../../../materials/images/grandpa-fish-and-the-radio.png)

-   Activity was "bought" from Akshara by Karadi Tales...Hah!
:::
:::

## RPG Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Step5: Verification: The Right Questions at the End

-   Go from General to Specific
-   Map the Role Play learnings / concepts back to events and characters in the book
-   Socratic Questions(3-4) as to how the role play relates to the book
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
-   E.g “Ruby Red Rose Red”:
    -   How did Raju share his fruit?
    -   How did they cut it?
    -   Which fruit in the book already nicely divided up? ( Fractions activity with Origami)

![](../../../materials/images/ruby-red-rosy-red.png)
:::
:::

## RPG Design Process Metaphor {background-image="../../../materials/images/spindle.jpg" background-opacity="0.5" background-size="contain"}

-   Think of the RPG Design Process as a Spindle shape...

-   Narrow to Broad: Book -\> Questions -\> Game: Specific to General Concept

-   Broad to Narrow: Game -\> Questions -\> Book: General to Specific

-   Book is "Specific"

-   Concept ( i.e. MLL) is "General"

-   Need to leave the *specific* of the book to the general of the concept and [return](https://youtu.be/d1Zxt28ff-E).

## What did we achieve?{.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Set Theory with Class 3 kids!! {{< iconify game-icons surprised >}}
-   [Rayleigh Scattering](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html) with only body as props
-   Solar System and Eclipses
-   Time Zones -.....
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Traffic
-   Math in Daily Life
-   Shapes, Sizes and Objects
-   Communication Tech and How it works
-   "Citizen" Systems and Services ( Police / Ration Shops...)
:::
:::

::: aside
-   Language: Kan / Urd / Tam / Tel
-   EVS: Geography, History, Civics
-   Maths
:::

## Sample RPG Document

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Yup it is the one about Rayleigh Scattering!

# Teaching with Lego

## Lego Activity Design Method {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="45%"}

-   Very Similar Process with Book Mining
-   Activity Used Lego Model building *before* reading the Book
-   Models first, then Socratic Questions
-   Then read the Book and more Socratic Questions

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

-   Even more free and spontaneous
-   RPG had a "process" and "steps";
-   With LEGO, there was more freedom up front in model-making
-   Mapping the Models to Book was **documented** for the Librarian

Celestia lets you explore our universe in three dimensions.

Celestia simulates many different types of celestial objects. From planets and moons to star clusters and galaxies, you can visit every object in the expandable database and view it from any point in space and time. The position and movement of solar system objects is calculated accurately in real time at any rate desired.

- Does not need to be installed!!
- Can boot from DVD/USB or even from a local network
- Edubuntu LTSP Project 
  - can have a lot of very old and simple desktops function as clients
  - One machine acts as server
  - <https://www.eifl.net/system/files/resources/201609/ltspguide-english.pdf>

-   Resource Team: 5 days in office, 25 days in the Field!
-   Set of Routes with 3-5 libraries
-   Routes were randomly chosen for the week

# An RCT into Teaching

- Randomized Control Treatment Projects into the Efficacy of the Libraries
- Do you want to hear about this?

# Conclusion

## So How did We Resolve the Challenges?{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
- Designing Activities is hard, so it was done centrally
- Librarians were trained on execution only
- Some Librarians were involved in "user testing" and even conceptualization stage
- Time Tables so as to minimize commuting for Librarians
- Even designed a Akshara Librarians Bag! (Didn't work...)

:::

::: {.column width='60%'}

- Rejuvenated over 400 computers with Edubuntu
- Even left Edubuntu DVDs in Libraries in case
- Trained Librarians in Edubuntu + Activities
