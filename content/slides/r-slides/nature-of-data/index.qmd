### What makes Human Experience?

### How would we begin to describe this experience?

-   Where / When?
-   Who?
-   How?
-   How Big? How small? How frequent? How sudden?
-   And....How Surprising ! How Shocking! How sad...How Wonderful !!!\
    So: Our Questions, and our *Surprise* lead us to creating Human
    Experiences.

Jane Austen knew a lot about human information processing as these
snippets from **Pride and Prejudice** *(published in 1813 -- over 200
years ago)* show :

-   She was a woman of mean understanding, little *information* , and
    uncertain temper.
-   Catherine and Lydia had *information* for them of a different sort.
-   When this *information* was given, and they had all taken their
    seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,...
-   You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you
    certain *information* on that head than myself, for I have been
    connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.
-   This *information* made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
    Bingley.
-   This *information*, however, startled Mrs. Bennet ...

## Experiments and Hypotheses: A Kitchen Experiment

-   Inputs are: Ingredients, Recipes, Processes
-   Outputs are: Taste, Texture, Colour, Quantity!!

## What is the Result of an Experiment?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   All experiments give us data about phenomena
-   We obtain data about the things that happen: **Outputs**
-   What makes things happen?: **Inputs**
-   How?: **Process**
-   When? **Factors**
-   How much "output" is caused by how much "input"? **Effect Size**

::: {.column width="50%"}
All Experiments stem from Human Curiosity, a Hypothesis, and a Desire to
Find out and Talk about Something

In 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia. After the Russian Navy destroyed
a Turkish squadron in the Black Sea, Great Britain and France joined
with Turkey. In September of the following year, the British landed on
the Crimean Peninsula and set out, with the French and Turks, to take
the Russian naval base at Sevastopol.

What followed was a tragicomedy of errors -- failure of supply, failed
communications, international rivalries. Conditions in the armies were
terrible, and disease ate through their ranks. They finally did take
Sevastopol a year later, after a ghastly assault. It was ugly business
all around. Well over half a million soldiers lost their lives during
the Crimean War.

## Florence Nightingale's Data

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(HistData)
library(patchwork)
data("Nightingale")
knitr::kable(head(Nightingale[, c(2,3,8:10)], 10))

```

## How Does Data look Like, then?

:::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/content/materials/images/Ratio-Interval-Ordinal-Nominal.PNG)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
## Types of Variables - Using Interrogative Pronouns

-   Nominal: What? Who? Where? (Factors, *Dimensions*)
-   Ordinal: Which Types? What Sizes? How Big? (Factors, Dimensions)
-   Interval: How Often? (Numbers, *Facts*)
-   Ratio: How many? How much? How heavy? (Numbers, *Facts*)

## Types of Variables in Nightingale Data

### Using Interrogative Pronouns:[^1]

-   Nominal: None
-   Ordinal: (Factors, Dimensions)
    -   HOW? `War, Disease, Other`
-   Interval: (Numbers, *Facts*)
    -   WHEN? `Year, Month`
-   Ratio: (Numbers, *Facts*)
    -   HOW MANY? `Rate of Deaths` (War, Disease, Other)

[^1]: Nightingale's data table had *dimensions* coded into column names.
    This is not considered **tidy** in the modern age.
