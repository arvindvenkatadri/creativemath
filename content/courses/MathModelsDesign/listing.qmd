## Introduction

We will study several Mathematical Models and apply them to Art and
Design. The algorithms will be examined and then coded in ~~`R`~~
`p5.js`; however other open source tools (FOSS) may also be introduced
as and when needed.

This course stands on "three legs": **Maths**, **Code + Tech**, and
**Artifacts**, as shown below. As this course grows and hopefully becomes
more un-popular ;-D, more and more of these modules below will become
reality!
