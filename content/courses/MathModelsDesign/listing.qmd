## Introduction

We will study several Mathematical Models and apply them to Art and
Design. The algorithms will be examined and then coded in
[`p5.js`](https://q5js.org/home/) / [`q5.js`](https://q5js.org/home/) /
[`p5play.js`](https://p5play.org/) however other open source tools
(FOSS) and Javascript libraries may also be introduced as and when
needed.

This course stands on "three legs": **Maths**, **Code + Tech**, and
**Artifacts**, as shown below. As this course grows and hopefully
becomes more un-popular ;-D, more and more of these modules below will
become reality!
