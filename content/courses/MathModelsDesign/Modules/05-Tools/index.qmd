## Introduction

In this module, our goals are:\
- installing p5.js on our desktops\
- installing an IDE ( Integrated Development Environment). We will choose VSCode.\
- installing a webserver so that we can see our code outputs locally\
- learn something of the workflow, which we will consistently use in this course.

## Installing `p5.js`

Head off to <https://p5js.org/download/> and download the `Complete Library`. This is a .zip file that you should extract to a folder named `p5` within your `~/Documents` folder.

Your `p5` folder will look like this:

![p5 folder](../../../../materials/images/p5js_installation.png){#fig-p5js-installation}

## Installing Visual Studio Code

Head off to <https://code.visualstudio.com/download> and choose the appropriate file for your OS.

### Mac people
Check whether you have Apple silicon ( M1/M2/M3...) and choose appropriately. The `universal` version of the software also seems worth trying. 
:::

Open VS Code and click on `View` -> `Explorer`. Navigate to your `p5` folder and open it. This will allow you to edit all files there and keep track of other files within this "project" folder. 

## Installing a local WebServer

When we edit `p5.js` code within VS Code, we will want to see the resultant HTML rendering, since p5.js puts out an HTML file everytime. We need to *bind* this output to the browser using a VSCode Extension called, [Live Server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

> Instructions:\
> - Open the VS Code extension manager (CTRL-SHIFT-X / CMD-SHIFT-X)\
> - Search for and install the Live Server extension.\
> - Add a p5.js project folder to your VS Code Workspace. You have already done this.\
> - With your project's index.html ~~or sketch.js~~ file open, start the `Live Server` using the "Go Live" button in the status bar, or by using ALT-L ALT-O.\
> - Your sketch should now open in your default browser at location: 127.0.0.1:5500. Browser window usually pops up.
