## Introduction

The South Indian tradition of Kolam, and the [Angolan tradition of Lusona](https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/archive-files3/paulus_gerdes_lunda_geometry_mirror_curves_desbook4you.pdf) art have quite a few things in common. Both are also strongly linked to finite grammars and networks.

## Creating Kolams

How do we create these Kolam Patterns? Let us do this two ways: first
pretending we are a South-Indian Woman adorning her doorstep in the
morning. And then with two other methods, that lend themselves to
computation / iteration. So, first by hand!

## By Hand!

See if you can manually mimic some of the moves here! As an exercise,
try to **anchor your elbow and forearm to the table**, and draw the
pattern by rotating the paper! What are your observations?

### Method #1: Using **Canonical Pieces**

Here we use "pieces of Kolam" that are standard: by repeated usage of combinations of these pieces, ( I believe ) any kolam can be produced. Here is a video showing kolams with a few **canonical pieces**:

Which are the canonical pieces here?

### Method #2: Using Mirrors and Light

This follows the development of [Paul
Gerdes](https://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/paulus/index.html). 

First let us get a printable grid to make our Kolams manually, since
making grids can become tedious when you are making a lot of Kolams. We
can use the grid to place "pulli-s" on the grid to make our Kolam. Head
off to: <https://editor.p5js.org/arvindv/sketches/UuHApkvqd> and open it
in your p5.js web-editor. Print out a few samples of the `.svg` grid
file that is generated.

Now consider that each of your Kolam "lines" or "trajectories" is [made
of light](https://www.imaginary.org/program/frozenlight). And place some
single horizontal or vertical mirrors, at some locations *midway between
adjacent pulli-s*. See the figure below:

![Kolam with Mirrors](../../../../../materials/gifs/Kolam-With-Mirrors.png)

The black lines here are to be imagined as *"made of light"*. Whenever
they hit a mirror, a *"curved reflection"* occurs. Note how the
arrangement of mirrors is symmetric here. Can we take *computational
liberties* here and make asymmetric mirror arrangements? Can the grid
also be non-square? Try?

For more inspiration, see
[here](https://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/paulus/pg1.htm). This is a multipage article with many different grid+mirror arrangements! There is also an intriguing technique shown therein of **colouring the squares in the grid** alternatively white and black, to generate very symmetric shaded patterns!

### Kolams in p5.js

This is also the idea embedded in this toy called [Kolam
Tiles](https://talkingmathwithkids.com/shop/kolam-tiles/).
