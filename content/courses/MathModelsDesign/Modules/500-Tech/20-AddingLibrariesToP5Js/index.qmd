## Introduction

When we wish to use some feature that is not directly available in `p5.js`, say for example creating [Voronoi Tesselations using the c2.js library](https://c2js.org/examples.html), then we need to import that JavaScript library into our `p5.js` session that allows us to do that.


## Simple Instructions!

1. On your `p5.js` web editor, click the arrow on the left side and access the `index.html` file.

![Accessing index.html on p5js web editor](../../../../../materials/images/p5jsindexhtml.png){#fig-index-html}

1. Go to either [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or [cdnjs]() and get the `<script>` for your chosen library: 

![Script for `tonejs` @ cdnjs website](../../../../../materials/images/cdnjs.png){#fig-script-tonejs}


1. Paste that `<script>` tag and its contents into your `index.html`.

1. The library will now be available in your `sketch.js` and you can use the commands and features from that library therein. 


Here is a shortish video that tells us how to do this:
