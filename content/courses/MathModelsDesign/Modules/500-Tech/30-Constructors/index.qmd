## Introduction

`p5.js` allows us to use Javascript features such as **Objects**. An Object in `p5.js` is *a form of data + a set of things you can do with that data*, what are called **methods**. Think of an Object as a spanner in your toolkit, which can tell you the gauge/size of mechanical components and also do specific things with these. 

When would we need to use these? 

Some libraries in `p5.js`, such as `p5.sound` create **Oscillator** objects, which can generate sounds with different frequencies. And these have *methods* associated with them, such as turning them on/off, modifying their amplitudes and frequencies ("modulations"). 

We can also create our own Objects which can include some methods of their own.

## Examples of Objects

Let us see an example of a built-in Object type offered by `p5.js`. Then we will look at the way in which we can create Objects of our own.

### Objects in the `p5.sound` library



### Creating our own Obects
