## Introduction

We will predomnantly use `p5.js` in this course, since most of use have had some exposure to it and it if of course easy to acquire rapidly. Some R code may also be demonstrated. 

## The `p5.js` web editor

The best way to use `p5.js` is to use its web editor:

## Installing `p5.js` ( if you have to)

One may also install `p5.js`, for situations when one is not online, e.g. for stand-alone projects and public installations that do not have internet access. We will then also have to install a webserver so that we can see our code outputs locally.

Head off to <https://p5js.org/download/> and download the `Complete Library`. This is a .zip file that you should extract to a folder named `p5` within your `~/Documents` folder.

Your `p5` folder will look like this:

## Installing Visual Studio Code

Head off to <https://code.visualstudio.com/download> and choose the appropriate file for your OS.

### Mac people

Check whether you have Apple silicon ( M1/M2/M3...) and choose appropriately. The `universal` version of the software also seems worth trying. 
:::

Open VS Code and click on `View` -> `Explorer`. Navigate to your `p5` folder and open it. This will allow you to edit all files there and keep track of other files within this "project" folder. 

## Installing a local WebServer

When we edit `p5.js` code within VS Code, we will want to see the resultant HTML rendering, since `p5.js` puts out an HTML file everytime. We need to *bind* this output to the browser using a *VSCode Extension* called, [Live Server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).

  - Open the VS Code extension manager (CTRL-SHIFT-X / CMD-SHIFT-X)
 - Search for and install the Live Server extension.\
 - Add a p5.js project folder to your VS Code Workspace. You have already done this.
 - With your project's index.html ~~or sketch.js~~ file open, start the `Live Server` using the "Go Live" button in the status bar, or by using ALT-L ALT-O.
 - Your sketch should now open in your default browser at location: `127.0.0.1:5500`. Browser window usually pops up.
