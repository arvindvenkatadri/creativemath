## Introduction

How many strangers do you "meet" everyday? Why is the Human Species
different from all others? Those two questions are not unrelated !!

The Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to [cooperate
with strangers](https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf)!! Yes! Do you
think that building and conducting a business is something like that?
No? Well, let us see a few quick stories!!

### {{< iconify mdi audiobook >}} Fiction Time!

This is the conversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw
in the video above, from the book, the three musketeers.

[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S
GUARDS**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm).[^1]
Keep an eye on the conversation!

And an ear open for Frenchi-fied English, I beseech you[^2]!!

### {{< iconify mdi thought-bubble-outline >}} What are the Assumptions in Game Theory?

-   That gains and pains can be **quantified**
-   Rationality
-   Players have identical and opposed aims (Symmetry)
-   In most cases, the game is **zero-sum**
-   Some form of spoke/unspoken agreement as to what may and may not be
    done ( i.e Rules of the Game )

Here is a good Summary of modern thinking about Human Cooperation: *The
Evolution of Human Cooperation*,
