## Introduction

Would you wear a veshti/kurta/angavastram, or silk paavade to college?
When you want someone to *search the internet*, what do you tell them
do? How do you show someone that you agree with what they are doing at
that moment?

In the module on [Game Theory](../10-InteratedGames/iteratedGames.qmd)
we saw how we all are engaged in *adversarial transactional Games* with
many other people, most of whom are strangers to us. [The Prisoner's
Dilemma](../10-InteratedGames/iteratedGames.qmd#sec-nice-guys-finish-firsts).

As remarked before, the Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are
able to [cooperate with
strangers](https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf)!! So we are not always
adversaries or enemies, and we are able to obtain **unspoken agreement
and correspondence with strangers**.

What use would this be? An how do these ideas have anything to with
building businesses?

Today, we will study **Coordination Games** and **Schelling Focus
Points**, and see how these concepts can help better businesses.

### Coordination Games and Schelling Focus Points

Watch these two videos on the topic of Focal Points as defined by
Schelling.

Focal points can be used in Coordination Games: these are activities
where people's actions tend to **organize into Patterns** based on
specific default options. These actions could be

a)  Conversation

b)  Dress

c)  Travel / Meeting

d)  Location

e)  Attention

## How Does This Apply to Business?

Let us now look at a few uses of "cultural Schelling Points"!!

### Case Study #1: Tanishq Ad

### Case Study #2: Havell's Ad

{{< youtube OlMlwUZ-LK0 >}}

So:

1.  you want your customers to **coordinate** towards your product, your
    ad, your office, and ....you.
2.  You will use things or ideas that are **culturally salient** to your
    customers to enable that coordination!
3.  You location, your ad, your logo, your tag-line, your motto, your
    message, your company colours...all are capable of being Schelling
    Points that *focus* the attention of your customers
