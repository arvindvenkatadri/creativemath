## Introduction

CAC ( and CE?) students in SMI need to develop a world-view that allows them to think computationally under a wide variety of circumstances. With this viewpoint, they would look at both phenomena and objects to somehow ***quantize*** them: to [detect numbers where no numbers have gone before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before).

Is there a systematic way of doing this admittedly delusional thing?
Leaving aside its use in creating utility or beauty, or both).

What if we took ***simple ideas from maths / physics, chemistry, 
and biology*** ( at a stretch) and applied these as metaphors through 
which one were to both interpret and imagine the reality that one is 
contemplating? What might such a course plan look like?

## Course Plan

1. Intro to Metaphors and Models
    - Target and Source
    - Attributes and Transfer
    - Making Meaning
    - Difference between Metaphor and Model

1. Study and Modelling of Common Objects
    - Pendulum / Inclined Plane / Wheels
    - Shapes
    - States of Matter
    - Fields (Gravity / Electricity / Magnetism)
1. Study and Modelling of Common Phenomena
    - Oscillation / Cyclic Phenomena (e.g. IC Engines)
    - Movement / Acceleration / Friction
    - Attraction / Repulsion / Collision
    - Photo-synthesis 
    - Growth and Differentiation
    - Evaporation / Sedimentation / Decantation / Distillation
    - Electro-statics and Electro-Magnetics
1. Things Fall Apart
    - Extracting Attributes from Objects and Phenomena
    - Measurable and Imaginary Attributes and their properties
    - Values, Units, Scales, Variations, and Relationships
1. Generating Parallel Worlds
    - Simulating the Phenomena in Code (straightforward)
    - Does it represent something else?
        - What is "transferable"?
        - Make metaphoric worlds by "attribute transfer"
        - Detect "similar phenomena" elsewhere / alternate system/world
        - ..
    - Apply code to model to the "elsewhere"
        - Add more reality from alternative world and see "if it fits"
        - Create an artistic or utilitarian or combined artifact
