# Introduction

Network graphs show relationships between entities: what sort they are,
how strong they are, and even of they change over time.

We will examine data structures pertaining both to the *entities* and
the *relationships* between them and look at the data *object* that can
combine these aspects together. Then we will see how these are plotted,
what the *structure* of the plot looks like. There are also *metrics*
that we can calculate for the network, based on its structure. We will
of course examine geometric metaphors that can represent various classes
of entities and their relationships.

Network graphs can be rendered both as static and interactive and we
will examine R packages that render both kinds of plots.

There is a another kind of structure: one that combines *spatial* and
*network* data in one. We will defer that for a future module !

## What kind Network graphs will we make?

Here is a network map of the characters in Victor Hugo's
`Les Miserables`:

And this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
data(karate)
set.seed(123)
l <- layout.graphopt(karate)
karate %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% # to access nodes and edges in tidygraph
  
  # parameters to decorate the nodes
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(node_shape = if_else(V(karate)$label %in% c("H", "A"), 1, 2),
         node_size = 4*sqrt(igraph::degree(karate)),
         Faction = as_factor(Faction),
         node_shape = as_factor(node_shape)
         ) %>% 
  
  # parameters to decorate the edges
  activate(edges) %>%
  mutate(edge_color =
           case_when(
             edge_is_between(from = V(karate)$Faction == 1,
                             to = V(karate)$Faction == 2,
                             ignore_dir = TRUE) ~ 1L,

         edge_color = as_factor(edge_color)) %>%
  
  # now plot it
