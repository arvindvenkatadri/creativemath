## Setup the Packages

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggstream)

# remotes::install_github("corybrunson/ggalluvial@main", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(ggalluvial)

```

# What Time Evolution Charts can we plot?

In these cases, the x-axis is typically *time*...and we chart the
variable of another Quant variable with respect to time, using a *line*
geometry.

Let is take a healthcare budget dataset from [Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID):
We will plot graphs for 5 countries (India, China, Brazil, Russia,
Canada )

```{r charts, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
health <-
  read_csv("data/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID.csv")
health_filtered <- health %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c(
    "India",
    "China",
    "United States",
    "United Kingdom",
    "Russia",
    "Sweden"
  ))
p1 <- ggplot(health_filtered,
         aes(x = Year, y = public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp, colour = Entity)) + geom_line() + labs(y = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP")

p2 <-  
  ggplot(health_filtered,
         aes(x = Year, y = public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp, fill = Entity)) + geom_area()+ labs(y = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP")


p1 / p2 + plot_layout(nrow = 2) + plot_annotation(title = "Line and Area Charts to show Evolution (over Time )",subtitle = "", tag_levels = 'A') & theme_minimal()

```

## What Space Evolution Charts can we plot?

Here, the *space* can be any Qual variable, and we can chart another
Quant or Qual variable move across levels of the first chosen Qual
variable.

For instance we can contemplate Enrollment at a University, and show how
students move from course to course in a University. Or how customers
drift from one category of products or brands to another....or the
movement of cricket players from one IPL Team to another !!

> A Sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set
> of values to another. The things being connected are called
> **stages/axes**, **nodes / strata** and the connections are called
> **flows / links / alluvia**. Sankeys are best used when you want to
> show a many-to-many mapping between two domains or multiple paths
> through a set of stages E.g Students going through multiple courses
> during a semester of study.

```{r}
#| label: more-charts
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(ggalluvial)
data("Titanic")
Titanic %>% as_tibble() %>% 
ggplot(data = .,
       aes(axis1 = Class, axis2 = Sex, axis3 = Age,
           y = n)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Survived),size = .25) +
  geom_stratum() + 
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Class", "Sex", "Age"), 
                   expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgoldenrod", "purple")) + 
  xlab("Demographic") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("passengers on the maiden voyage of the Titanic",
          "stratified by demographics and survival")
```

Here is another example of a Sankey Diagram: This diagram show how
energy is converted or transmitted before being consumed or lost:
supplies are on the left, and demands are on the right. Data: Department

## Chord Diagram

TBD

## Conclusion

We see that we can visualize 'evolutions" over time and space. The
evolutions can represent changes in the **quantities** of things, or
their **categorical** affiliations or groups.

What business data would you depict in this way? Revenue streams?
Employment? Expenditures over time and market? There are many
possibilities!

## Your Turn

1.  Within the `ggalluvial` package are two datasets, `majors` and
    `vaccinations`. Plot alluvial charts for both of these.
2.  Go to the [American Life Panel
    Website](https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data) where you
    will find many public datasets. Try to take one and make charts from
    it that we have learned in this Module.
