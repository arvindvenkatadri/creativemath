## Introduction

We will get acquainted with the ~~RMarkdown~~ Quarto Document format,
which allows us to mix text narrative, code, code-developed figures and
items from the web in a seamless document.Then we can try to create
something in the lines of what Hans Rosling did.

Something that can:

-   provide a visualization
-   provide insight
-   tell a story
-   is reproducible

## Setting up Quarto

Quarto is installed along with RStudio. We can check if all is in order
by running a check in the `Terminal` in RStudio.

The commands are:

1.  `quarto check install`
2.  `quarto check knitr`

If these come out with no errors then we are ready to fire up our first
Quarto document.

## Practice

Fire up a new Quarto document by going to:
`File -> New File -> Quarto Document.`Switch to `Visual` mode, if it is
not already there.

Use the visual mode tool bar.

`Sections`, `code chunks`, `embedding images` and `tables`.

Hit the `Render` button to see how the documents is converted into an
`html` document.
