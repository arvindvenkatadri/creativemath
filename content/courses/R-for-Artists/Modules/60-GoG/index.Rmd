## Introduction

Ah...`ggplot` ! All those wonderful pictures and graphs, that Alice
might have relished!

Metaphors, aesthetics, geometries...and pictures !! `ggplot` seems to
equate ravens to writing desks in its syntax...and out come graphs!!

And colours: Wes Anderson! Tim Burton! The Economist... and many
others!!
