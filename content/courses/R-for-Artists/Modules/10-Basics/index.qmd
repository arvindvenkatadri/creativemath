## {{< fa envelope title="An envelope" >}} Where does Data come from?

We will need to form a basic understanding of basic scientific
enterprise. Let us look at the slides.

## {{< fa chart-simple >}} Why Visualize?

-   We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial
-   Our [Working
    Memories](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/working-memory-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)
    are both *short-term* and *limited* in capacity. So a picture
    abstracts the details and presents us with an overall summary, an
    insight, or a story that is both easy to recall and easy on
    retention.\
-   Data Viz includes *shapes* that carry strong cultural memories and
    impressions for us. These cultural memories help us to use data viz
    in a *universal way* to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. (Do
    humans have a gene for geometry?)
-   It helps sift facts and mere statements: for example:

Reveal?](/content/materials/images/data-reveals-crime.png){fig-align="center"}

: Questions and Types of Variables
:::

As you go from `Qualitative` to `Quantitative` data types in the table,
I hope you can detect a movement from fuzzy groups/categories to more
and more crystallized numbers.

![Type of
Variables](/content/materials/images/Ratio-Interval-Ordinal-Nominal.PNG){fig-align="center"}

Each variable/scale can be subjected to the operations of the previous
group. In the words of [S.S.
Stevens](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/)

> the basic operations needed to create each type of scale is
> cumulative: to an operation listed opposite a particular scale must be
> added all those operations preceding it.

## What Are the Parts of a Data Viz? {#sec-data-viz}

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

g <- diamonds %>% slice_sample(n = 500) %>% ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot Title", 
       subtitle = "Plot Subtitle",
       caption = "Plot Caption",
       x = "x-Axis Title",
       y = "y-Axis Title") + 
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title = "Plot Legend", 
                             colour = "orange")) + theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "panel",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, 
                                  colour = "orange"),
        legend.title = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, 
                                     colour = "orange"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, 
                                    colour = "orange"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12)
        )

annotation <- tibble(
   x = c(2,-0.01, 1.2),
   y = c(0, 10000, 17000),
   angle = c(0, 90, 0), 
   label = c("X-axis", "Y-axis", "Annotation")
)

# Add text
g + geom_text(data=annotation, aes( x=x, y=y, label=label, angle = angle),                 , 
           color="orange", 
           size=7 , fontface="bold" )
```

## How to pick a Data Viz?

Most Data Visualizations use one or more of the following geometric
attributes or aesthetics. These geometric aesthetics are used to
*represent* qualitative or quantitative variables from your data.

![Common Geometric Aesthetics in
Charts](/content/materials/images/common-aesthetics-1.png){fig-align="center"}

What does this mean? We can think of simple visualizations as
**combinations** of these aesthetics. Some examples:
