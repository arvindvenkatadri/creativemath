## Introduction to Orange

**Orange** is a visual drag-and-drop tool for

- Data visualization  
- Statistical Tests
- Machine Learning  
- Data mining  

and much more. Here is what it looks like:

All operations are done using a visual menu-driven interface. We drag and drop *widgets* that can have inputs and outputs. Widgets perform operations on data sent to them by other widgets. 
The visuals can be exported to PNG/SVG/PDF and the entire workflow can be exported into a Report Form and edited for presentation and sharing. 

Orange also has add-ons that provide widgets for specific tasks such as Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis and so on.

## Simple Visuals using Orange

Let us create some simple visualizations using Orange. 

- Use the File Widget to import the `iris` dataset into your session
- Use the Data Table Widget to look at the data, and note its variable names
- Use the Visualization Widgets ( Scatter Plot, Bar Plot, and Distributions) to look at the properties of the variables, and examine relationships between them.
