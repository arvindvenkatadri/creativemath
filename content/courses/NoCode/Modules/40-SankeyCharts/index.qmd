## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Sometimes Qual data can itself vary over, or depend upon, over a bunch
of independent Qual data *categories*. For instance we can contemplate
enrollment at a University, and show how students move from course to
course in a University. Or how customers drift from one category of
products or brands to another....or the movement of cricket players from
one IPL Team to another !!

As can be surmised, the independent *categories* can be interpreted both
as **time** ( e.g semesters / cycles / years) and **space** (teams /
courses / departments). And we can chart another Quant or Qual variable
that moves across levels of the first chosen Qual variable.

![](../../../../materials/images/sankey.png){fig-align="center"
width="800"}

-   The Qualitative variables being connected are mapped to
    `stages/axes`
-   Each *level* within a Qual variable is mapped to
    `nodes / strata / lodes`;
-   And the connections between the `strata` of the `axes` are called
    `flows / links / alluvia`.\

Such diagrams are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping
between two domains or multiple paths through a set of stages E.g
Students going through multiple courses during a semester of study.

Here is an example of a Sankey Diagram for the `Titanic` dataset:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-titanic-sankey-plot
#| fig-cap: "Titanic Sankey Plot"
theme_set(theme_classic())
##
library(ggalluvial)
data("Titanic")
Titanic <- Titanic %>% as_tibble()

Titanic %>% ggplot(data = .,
    
# Select the Categorical Variables for the vertical Axes / Stages
       aes(axis1 = Class, 
           axis2 = Sex, 
           axis3 = Age,
           axis4 = Survived,
           y = n), fill = "white") +
  
# Alluvials between Categorical Axes
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Survived), 
                colour = "black", 
                linewidth = 0.25) +
  
# Vertical segments for each Categorical Variable2 
  geom_stratum(colour = "black", 
               linewidth = 1, 
               fill = "white") + 
  
# Labels for each "level" of the Categorical Axes
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", 
            aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  

  
# Scales and Colours
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Class", "Sex", "Age"), 
                   expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green")) + 
  
  xlab("Demographic") +
  ggtitle("Passengers on the maiden voyage of the Titanic",
          "Stratified by demographics and survival")

```

It is seen from @fig-titanic-sankey-plot that the x-axis has Qual
variables `stages` shown as "pillars" and these are split into `nodes`
based on the levels for each Qual variable `stage` respectively. `Flows`
with variable thickness connect one `node` at one `stage` to another
`node` and another `stage`.

### Sankey, Parallel sets, and Alluvial Charts

Here is what [Thomas Lin
Pedersen](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_parallel_sets.html)
says:

A **parallel sets diagram** is a type of visualisation showing the
interaction between multiple categorical variables.

If the variables have an **intrinsic order** the representation can be
thought of as a **Sankey Diagram**.

If each variable is a point in time it will resemble an **Alluvial
diagram**.

### Using Orange

It does not seem possible to create an Alluvial Diagram in Orange.
`r emoji::emoji("cry")`

### Using RAWgraphs

{{< video https://youtu.be/6BYac2Pmnno >}}

{{< downloadthis AlluvialDiagram/TutorialAlluvialDiagram.rawgraphs dname="TutorialAlluvialDiagram" label="Download the RAWgraphs Alluvial Tutorial File" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

Download this file and upload to <https://app.rawgraphs.io/>.

Let us however examine this data in Orange:

{{< downloadthis AlluvialDiagram/2020HateCrimesInNY.csv dname="HateCrimesInNY" label="Download the Hate Crimes dataset" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

![Hate Crimes in NY
2020](../../../../materials/images/Orange/hate-crimes-data-table.png){#fig-hate-crime-data-table}

From the @fig-hate-crime-data-table, We see that the data is all
Qualitative, except for `Age`. The `Precinct`, while apparently an
integer, is really a Qual variable! Why?

And here is the Sankey Diagram:

![Hate Crime Sankey
Diagram](AlluvialDiagram/TutorialAlluvialDiagram.png){#fig-hate-crime-sankey}

In the @fig-hate-crime-sankey, we have three Qual variables along the
x-axis: `Gender`, `Race` and `Bias-Motivation`. The chart *counts* the
crime episodes at each `stage/node` and portrays them as flows with
varying thickness leading to the next `stage/node`.

What trends do you detect from this diagram?

### Using DataWrapper

It does not seem possible to create an Alluvial Diagram in DataWrapper.

## {{< iconify uiw pay >}} Dataset: Course Allocations

Let us try one more dataset:

{{< downloadthis ../../../../materials/Data/FSPAllocationCleanDataFile.csv dname="courses" label="Download the FSP Course Allocation data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

Let us still import into Orange and see the data anyway!

![Course Allocation
Data](../../../../materials/images/Orange/course-allocation-data-table.png){#fig-course-allocation-data-table}

From @fig-course-allocation-data-table, we see that we have 300 students
and their course allocations over one Foundation year at SMI. (The data
is anonymized but accurate; no staff or students were harmed in the
collection of this data)!

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?
Write in!!


## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

1.  Within the `ggalluvial` package from R, are two datasets, `majors` and `vaccinations`. Plot alluvial charts for both of these, and write their stories. 
    
```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggalluvial)
majors %>% download_this(output_name = "majors", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Majors data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")
```
\
```{r}
#| echo: false
vaccinations %>% download_this(output_name = "vaccinations", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Vaccinations data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")


```
\

2.  Go to the [American Life Panel
    Website](https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data) where you
    will find many public datasets. Try to take one and make charts from
    it that we have learned in this Module.

3. Try this from Vincent Arel-Bundock's website: [Cybersecurity breaches reported to the US Department of Health and Human Services](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Ecdat/HHSCyberSecurityBreaches.html). The dataset is downloadable here [CSV](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/HHSCyberSecurityBreaches.csv). NOTE: data may require some cleaning beforehand in Excel!

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Mosaic Charts gave us a view of **counts** of data across level-combinations of Qual variables.
- Sankey/Alluvial Charts give us a sense of *flow*: how did different observations flow from one Qual level to another? 
- This is very valuable if these Qual variables and their levels have a natural *sequence*. E.g. Choices made in purchases, Attitudes over time and situation, Affiliations and Friendships over time etc.
- The sequence may even be conceptualized as a *consequence*, provided you have adequate insight into the situations involved. 
- You get a sense of the sub-populations in each *combo* of Qual variables and can decide what to do about both plenitude and rarity!
