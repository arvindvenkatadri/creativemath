Dumbbell and Radar Charts for Ranking

::: 

What do we see here? From <https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/americas-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-2024/> : 

From @fig-electricity-sources:

- `Onshore wind power` effectively costs $0 per megawatt-hour (MWh) when subsidies are included!\
- Demand for storage solutions is rising quickly. If storage is included, the minimum cost for `onshore wind` increases to $8 per MWh.\
- Solar photovoltaics (PV) have similarly attractive economics. With subsidies, the minimum cost is $6 per MWh. When including storage, $38 per MWh. Notably, the maximum cost of solar PV with storage has significantly increased from $102 in 2023 to $210 in 2024.\
- For gas-combined cycle plants, which combine natural gas and steam turbines for efficient electricity generation, the maximum price has climbed $7 year-over-year to $108 per MWh.\

And from From @fig-baseball-5tools?

- There is a clear difference in the capabilities of the three players compared, though all of them are classified as "5 tools" players. \
- Each player is better than the others at one unique skill: Betts at `Throwing`, Judge at `Hit_power`, and Trout at `Hit_avg`.\



## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Dumbbell charts show **changes in rank/attainment/performance** *of* several entities *over* two "instants in time" or two "points of interest". ( Note these two prepositions!! ) The chart is usually sorted to show the entity with the largest change at the very top, or the very bottom. The Y-axis is the "entity" variable (Qual!) and the X-axis is a SINGLE *rank* or *measure of attainment/performance* (Quant!). In the above chart, we saw different energy sources as "entities" and their cost as the performance measure, and the energy sources were (roughly) ranked in order of the change in cost. The shape is of course, a bar/dumbbell with endpoints. The length of the bar is proportional to the change. 

A Radar chart does not show *change*; it simply plots a set of **static performance measures or ranks**. However these measures or ranks are *not* a single performance measure but MULTIPLE. So how do we have multiple X-axes then? We use *angle* and create as many axes as we need depending upon the number of measures we wish to show, all axes diverging from a single point. The performance measure us marked off along each such angled axis, usually with the same **scale** (though that may require external pre-processing). The final shape is of course a polygon, and we can plot many "entities" as overlapping, semi-transparent polygons. In the plot above, the entities are the players, and the performance measures are the so-called 5 tools of baseball.

### Using Orange
There does not appear to be a way of plotting dumbbell charts in Orange. `r emoji::emoji("cry")`.

### Using RAWgraphs
There does not appear to be a way of plotting dumbbell charts in RAWgraphs. `r emoji::emoji("cry")`.

### Using DataWrapper
In DataWrapper, a dumbbell plot is referred to as a `range plot`, which is also quite an appropriate name: <br>
<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/111-how-to-create-a-range-plot>

Another rather similar and evocative plot on DataWrapper is the `arrow plot`: <https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/123-how-to-create-an-arrow-plot>

Here is an example of a dumbbell chart/range chart created in DataWrapper. This chart **ranks** different countries on how much better off the nursing profession is in those countries. (The comparison is with the UK).

Hit the `Get the data` button, and then upload it into <https://app.datawrapper.de/> and see if you can recreate this chart:

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: Brood Parasites - Cuckoo Eggs and Host Eggs

Cuckoo birds drop their eggs into other birds' nests, where they hatch and are looked after by the unwitting host-parent bird, often at the cost of their own babies, a phenomenon known as brood parasitism.

The data is available at Vincent Arel-Bundock's website: <https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/DAAG/cuckoohosts.csv>. Use this URL to directly import into Orange. 


The dataset contains dimensions of the eggs of the host birds and compares them to that of the cuckoo. Import this dataset into Orange and look at the variables, their nature, and their summaries.

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

A data frame with 10 observations on the following 12 variables. Each row corresponds to a host species bird.

## Question #1
Q1. How different are length, breadth (mean) of host eggs different from those of the cuckoo's eggs

:::


::: callout-note
## Question #2
Q2. Are the statistical measures (standard deviations) of the length/breadth different between cuckoo and host eggs?

:::


### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

- The @fig-bird-eggs-radar-chart shows that both mean-lengths and mean-breadths of the eggs are nearly the same between those of the host and the cuckoo! `r emoji::emoji("open_mouth")`. The poor host bird has little chance of detecting the parasite egg purely by dimensions....
- From @fig-bird-eggs-stats-radar-chart, the statistical variations are also nearly the same, **except** for a few host species where the variation (sd) in the host-egg-length is much larger.
- This aspect is seen better in @fig-bird-eggs-stats-facetted-radar-chart, where for the Wren, the Robin, and the Hedge Sparrow, *....s-o-m-e..* times, the parasite cuckoo egg may be much smaller and perhaps detectable..but again small size may render it inconspicous! 
- But..is this over time? Are all the eggs the same age?...Ummm...

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: Employment vs Population vs Gender

This is a dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/employment-to-population-ratio-men-vs-women). Download this data and import into Orange to take a look at it. We might then decide what we wish to see by way of a chart and pre-process the data and saving it with Orange. Then we will send this data to RAWGraphs/DataWrapper to plot our charts.

```{r}
#| echo: false
read_csv("../../../../materials/Data/employment-to-population-ratio-men-vs-women.csv") %>% download_this(output_name = "employment", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Employment Data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save",   class = "hvr-sweep-to-left")
  
  
```


We will as usual examine the data in Orange, filter and process as needed, and then use the other tools to plot charts to answer our Questions. The workflow for Orange is downloadable with the button below:

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?
With a simple but effective chart like this, we can tell the story pretty quickly:

- India and Pakistan have huge differences between the employment percentages of women and men.
- All countries shown in the chart have a higher percentage of men employed than women.

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- We can measure some Performance metric about entities such as Products, Brands, Shops, Companies, Stock Prices/Earnings and see how it changes over two instances of measurement, with a dumbbell chart. 
- The length of the dumbbells tells a very clear story.
- Dumbbell Plots are clearly are more intuitive and clear than the corresponding bar chart:

![Employment Gender Bar Chart](../../../../materials/images/dumbbell-vs-bar.png){#fig-dumbbell-vs-barchart}

- Differences between the same set of data at two different *aspects* is very quickly apparent
- *Differences in differences(DID)* are also quite easily apparent. Experiments do use these metrics and these plots would be very useful there. 
- If entities have their performance or quality measured over several different "aspects", a radar chart would serve you well. Do you think Dumbledore could have used a Radar Chart to decide [who could have won the House Trophy at Hogwarts](https://qr.ae/p28qKE)?
- The area(s) and non-overlapping parts of the (overlaid) radar chart are very evocative of superior performance.
