## What graphs will we see today?

Some of the very basic and commonly used plots for data are:\
- Bar and Column Charts\
- Histograms and Frequency Distributions\
- Scatter Plots (if there is more than one quant variable)
and\
- 2D Hexbins Plots and 2D Frequency Distributions (horrors!!)\

### How do these Work?

Histograms are best to show the distribution of raw *quantitative data*, by displaying the number of values that fall within defined ranges, often called *buckets* or *bins*. 

Although histograms may look similar to bar/column charts, the two are different. First, histograms show *continuous data*, and usually you can adjust the bucket ranges to explore frequency patterns. For example, you can shift histogram buckets from 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc. to 0-2, 2-4, etc.

By contrast, bar/column charts show *categorical data*, such as the number of apples, bananas, carrots, etc. Second, histograms do not usually show spaces between buckets because these are *continuous values*, while column charts show spaces to separate each *category*.

## {{< iconify logos netflix-icon >}} Dataset: Netflix Original Series
Here is a look at this data. It is readily available as on the in-bult datasets at RAWgraphs. 

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

```{r}
#| echo: false
netflix <- read_csv("BarChart/NetflixSeries2013_2017.csv")
netflix
netflix_inspect <- netflix %>% mosaic::inspect()
netflix_inspect$categorical %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped", "responsive"))
###
netflix_inspect$quantitative %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped", "responsive"))

```

::: callout-note
## Quantitative Data
- `Premiere_Year`: <int> Year the movie premiered
- `Seasons`: <int> No. of Seasons
- `Episodes`: <int> No. of Episodes
- `IMDB_Rating`: <int> IMDB Rating!!
:::

::: callout-note
## Qualitative Data
- `Genere`: <chr> 10 types of Genres
- `Title`: <chr> 109 titles
- `Subgenre`: <chr> 42 types of sub-Genres
- `Status`: <chr> 4 levels, status on Netflix
:::

### Research Questions
Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Bar Charts. Recall that Bar Charts show **counts** of Qualitative variables!

Q1. How many movies of each `Genere`? Sort them by `Genere`!
Q2. Which `Genere` has the highest average `IMDB_Rating`? Some grouping + aggregating needed here!

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: Banned Books in the USA

Here is a dataset from Jeremy Singer-Vine's blog, [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/). This is a list of all books banned in schools across the US. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
banned <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "./banned.xlsx",
                            sheet = "Sorted by Author & Title") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

banned
```

Download this data to your machine and use it on RAWGraphs. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
banned %>% download_this(output_name = "banned", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Banned Books data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")

``` 



### What is the Story Here?



## Frequency Distributions


## 2D Frequency Distributions and Hexbin plots

### What is the Story here?

TBD



## An Example: Frequency Density

### How does this work?

Let us listen to the late great Hans Rosling from the [Gapminder Project](https://www.gapminder.org), which aims at telling stories of the world with data, to remove systemic biases about poverty, income and gender related issues.

### How could you explore?
TBD. Add 2D contour plots and link up to `hexbin plots`.

## Your Turn

```{r echo=FALSE}
airbnb <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/1_OneNum.csv", header=TRUE)

apartments <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/2_TwoNum.csv", header=T, sep=",") %>% select(GrLivArea, SalePrice)

```

1. Rbnb Price Data on the French Riviera: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
airbnb %>% download_this(output_name = "airbnb",output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Rbnb data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")
```  


1. Apartment price vs ground living area: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
apartments %>% download_this(output_name = "apartments", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Apartment Data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save",   class = "hvr-sweep-to-left")
```
(Try a Scatter Plot too, since we have two Quant variables)
