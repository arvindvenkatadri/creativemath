## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Line Plots take two separate Quant variables as inputs. Each of the variables is mapped to a position, or coordinate: one for the X-axis, and the other for the Y-axis. Each pair of *observations* from the two Quant variables ( which would be in one row!) give us a `point`. All this much is identical with the [Scatter Plot](../30-ScatterPlots#index.qmd). 

And here, the points are connected together and sometimes thrown away altogether, leaving just the line. 

Looking at the lines, we get a very *function-al* sense of the variation: is it upward or downward? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it periodic or seasonal...all these questions can be answered with Line Charts.  

::: callout-important
### When one variable is Time?
Line charts often have one variable as a *time* variable. In such case the data is said to be a **time series**. We *might* deal with [Time Series](../80-Time/index.qmd) later. 
Any metric that is measured over regular time intervals forms a **time
series**. Analysis of Time Series is commercially important because of
industrial need and relevance, especially with respect to Forecasting
(Weather data, sports scores, population growth figures, stock prices,
demand, sales, supply...). For example, in the graph shown below are the
temperatures over time in two US cities:

Looks like an interesting story here...there are significantly fewer
births on average on Sat and Sun, over the years! Why? Should we watch
[Grey's Anatomy](https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/greys-anatomy/14823) ?

And why more births in September? That should be a no-brainer!! `r emoji::emoji("laugh")`

### Using Orange

Let us at least look at this data in Orange, and import it into this rather elaborate Orange Workflow:

::: {layout-ncol=2}
{{< downloadthis Orange/time-series.ows dname="TimeSeriesWorkflow" label="Download the Orange Time Series Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

{{< downloadthis rawGraphs/LineChart/RIAA-RevenuesPerMusicFormat.csv dname="MusicRevenueData" label="Download the RIAA Music Revenue data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

:::

Import this into Orange and see...

![RIAA Revenues Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/music-data-table.png){#fig-riaa-data-table}


@fig-riaa-data-table states that there are 432 data points, with 7 variables in the dataset; some missing data. 

For now, the variables we need are :

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data

-   `Year`: (int) Year in which RIAA revenue was logged
-   `Value (For Charting)`: (int) Revenue in million USD
We can ignore the rest for now, unless we plan to work more with this data, and need to know more. The other numerical data showing *billions* of USD are not easily decipherable, an example of data that is not documented well...

:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `Category`: (chr) Form of the Music released ( CD etc..)

:::

We need to first `form time series` from the dataset: we will choose the `year-date` variable, and indicate that it starts on Jan 1, 1973:

Upload this into <https://app.rawgraphs.io/> and play! Here is something we can create there:

![](images/music.png)

### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/23-how-to-create-a-line-chart>

Here be dragons: DataWrapper wants the data in [*wide format*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wide_and_narrow_data): each `Format` of music needs to have its figures in a separate column! `r emoji::emoji("facepalm")`. And this is not a data transformation that we can achieve within DataWrapper. Bah.

We are probably better off plotting a regular scatter plot. Here too there seem to be limitations because we are not able to colour the series based on type of music `Format`. 

#### The Shape of [~~You~~](https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8) Data

Never mind that silly song now. 

As mentioned above, data can be in [wide or long form](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wide_and_narrow_data). How does one imagine this shape-shifting that seems needed now and then? Let's see. 

::: callout-important
### Long Form and Wide Form Data
Several tools such as DataWrapper (and others, yes, I agree, even with code, as we will see) need data transformed to a specific **shape**. this is usually mandated by the "shape or geometry" we intend to use in the visualization. We should now look at this *idea* of *shape* in data. Consider the data tables below:

```{r}
#| label: fig-pivotting-data
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: body-outset-right

## Wide Form
set.seed(4)
df4 <- tibble(Product = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
              Power = runif(3), 
              Cost = runif(3),
              Harmony = runif(3),
              Style = runif(3),
              Size = runif(3),
              Manufacturability = runif(3),
              Durability = runif(3),
              Universality = runif(3))
df4 %>% kbl()
## 
df4 %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -Product, names_to = "Parameter", values_to = "Rating") %>% kbl()

```

What we have done is:\

- convert all the variable names into a stacked column `Parameter`\
- Put all the numbers into another column `Rating`\
- Repeated the `Product` column values as many times as needed to cover all `Parameter`s (8 times).\

See the gif below to get an idea of how this transformation can be worked reversibly. (Yeah, never mind the code also.)

![](../../../../materials/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif)
:::

So how can we actually do this? Turns out there are some nice people at U. San Diego who have built an R-oriented app called [Radiant  for Business Analytics](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/about.html) that can do this pretty much click-and-point style, though it is nowhere as much fun as Orange. Head off there:\

<https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant>

We upload our original data, pivot it, and download the pivotted data. Now the pivotted wide-form data should work in DataWrapper. 

Whatever, peasants.

## What is the Story here?
- Over the years different music formats have had their place in the sun
- All *physical* forms are on the wane; *streaming* music is the current mode of music consumption.


## {{< iconify emojione-v1 statue-of-liberty >}} {{< iconify mdi airport >}} Dataset: Weather at New York City Airports

To get an idea of *seasons*, *trends* and to try our hand at time-series forecasting, let us look at a data set pertaining to the weather at New York city airports.

```{r}
#| label: nyc-weather-data
#| echo: false
data(weather, package = "nycflights13")
weather %>% write_csv("../../../../materials/Data/weather.csv")
# Do not use this yet because it puts commas instead of decimal points
# In places !!
# weather %>% download_this(output_name = "weather",output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "NYC Weather data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")


```

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

Included below is a PDF report from Orange, summarizing the data, generated from the `Feature Summary` widget::

{{< pdf Orange/weather-report.pdf >}}


![Weather Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/weather-data-table.png){#fig-weather-data-table}

We should take the first column `time_hour` and see if we can use that as our time variable. All the weather related numerical data columns are individual *time series* which we can plot and analyse. 


### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data
- `time_hour`(num): Numeric date-time variable. Does Orange spot this?
- `year`(num): Just 2013.
- `month`, `day`, `hour`(num): components of the exact time of measurement of weather parameters

- `humid`,`temp`,`wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib` (num): all numeric weather parameters 
:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `origin` (text): airport (JKF/EWR/LGR)

:::

Let us build an Orange workflow step-by-step for this dataset and its Research Questions.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions
There are a lot of parameters to play with and investigate here. 

::: callout-note
## Question
Q1. What is Temperature `temp` over time at each of three airports?
![NYC Airport Temperatures over Time](../../../../materials/images/Orange/weather-nyc-airports-temp.png){#fig-weather-nyc-airports-temp}
It seems the `Line Chart` widget in Orange cannot colour individual time series by colour using another Qualitative variable. `r emoji::emoji("cry")`. Is there a better way?

Also note the utter busy-ness of this chart. This is a chart of 26K points, well beyond what we can digest at one time. We need to summarize/average etc.


:::



::: callout-note
## Question
Q2. In the US, there is a lot of talk of "wind chill factor". So, is there some graphical evidence of windchill? (`temp` and `wind_speed`)?
