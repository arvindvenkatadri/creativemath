## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Line Plots take two separate Quant variables as inputs. Each of the variables is mapped to a position, or coordinate: one for the X-axis, and the other for the Y-axis. Each pair of *observations* from the two Quant variables ( which would be in one row!) give us a `point`. All this much is identical with the [Scatter Plot](../30-ScatterPlots#index.qmd). 

And here, the points are connected together and sometimes thrown away altogether, leaving just the line. 

Looking at the lines, we get a very *function-al* sense of the variation: is it upward or downward? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it periodic or seasonal...all these questions can be answered with Line Charts.  



## {{< iconify ph chart-scatter-bold  >}} Plotting a Scatter Plot

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using Orange

Although this widget exists, ![](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/widget-icons/__optimized-images__/Visualize-Line%20Plot.png), it does not provide quite the kind of *Line Chart* is considered standard in the data viz industry. 

Nonetheless, let us at least look at this data in Orange, before plotting it elsewhere. Yes, peasants. 

{{< downloadthis rawGraphs/LineChart/RIAA-RevenuesPerMusicFormat.csv dname="MusicRevenueData" label="Download the RIAA Music Revenue data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

Import this into Orange and see...(sigh)

![RIAA Revenues Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/music-data-table.png){#fig-riaa-data-table}


@fig-riaa-data-table states that there are 432 data points, with 7 variables in the dataset; some missing data. 

For now, the variables we need are :

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data

-   `Year`: (int) Year in which RIAA revenue was logged
-   `Value (For Charting)`: (int) Revenue in million USD
We can ignore the rest for now, unless we plan to work more with this data, and need to know more. The other numerical data showing *billions* of USD are not easily decipherable, an example of data that is not documented well...

:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `Category`: (chr) Form of the Music released ( CD etc..)

### Using RAWgraphs

Upload this into <https://app.rawgraphs.io/> and play! Here is something we can create there:

![](images/music.png)

### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/23-how-to-create-a-line-chart>

Here be dragons: DataWrapper wants the data in *wide format*: each `Format` of music needs to have its figures in a separate column! `r emoji::emoji("facepalm")`. And this is not a data transformation that we can achieve within DataWrapper. 

We are probably better off plotting a regular scatter plot. Here too there seem to be limitations because we are not able to colour the series based on type of music `Format`. 

:::

## What is the Story here?
- Over the years different music formats have had their place in the sun
- All *physical* forms are on the wane; *streaming* music is the current mode of music consumption.


::: callout-important
### Long Form and Wide Form Data
Several tools such as DataWrapper (and others, yes, I admit, even with code, as we will see) need data transformed to a specific **shape**. We should now look at this *idea* of *shape* in data. Consider the data tables below:

```{r}
#| label: fig-pivotting-data
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: body-outset-right

## Wide Form
set.seed(4)
df4 <- tibble(Product = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
              Power = runif(3), 
              Cost = runif(3),
              Harmony = runif(3),
              Style = runif(3),
              Size = runif(3),
              Manufacturability = runif(3),
              Durability = runif(3),
              Universality = runif(3))
df4 %>% kbl()
## 
df4 %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -Product, names_to = "Parameter", values_to = "Rating") %>% kbl()

```

What we have done is:\
- convert all the variable names into a stacked column `Parameter`\
- Put all the numbers into another column `Rating`\
- Repeated the `Product` column values as many times as needed to cover all `Parameter`s (8 times).\

See the gif below to get an idea of how this transformation can be worked reversibly. (Yeah, never mind the code there.)

![](../../../../materials/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif)
:::

So how can we actually do this? Turns out there are some nice people at U. San Diego who have built an R-oriented app that can do this pretty much click-and-point, though it is nowhere as much fun as Orange. Head off here:

<https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant>
We upload our original data, pivot it, and download the pivotted data. Peasants. 

Now the pivotted wide-form data should work in DataWrapper.


## {{< iconify game-icons sad-crab >}} Dataset: Cancer



{{< downloadthis data/cancer.csv dname="cancer" label="Download the Cancer dataset" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

We can use the same Workflow as before. 

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

![Cancer Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-data-table.png){#fig-cancer-data-table}


From @fig-cancer-data-table, we see that there is *one* Qual column `Diagnosis`, and all the remaining 31 columns seem to be some Quant measurements of a total of 569 tumours. (Not all columns are visible)

![Cancer Data Summary Table #1](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-summary-table.png){#fig-cancer-data-summary}


@fig-cancer-data-summary gives is histograms and statistics of all the 32 columns. Most histograms seem roughly symmetric, but a detailed look must be taken. 

![Cancer Data Summary Table #2](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-summary-table-2.png){#fig-cancer-data-summary-2}

In @fig-cancer-data-summary-2, we see that there is some imbalance between the *counts* for the one Qual variable, `Diagnosis`.

:::
- Many of the Quant variables seem to be `mean` measurements, with the mean presumably taken over several "sites" within the same tumour. 
- Along with the `mean`, there are also measurements of `se` or *standard error* which is, roughly speaking, a measure of the `standard deviation` of the multiple measurements made. 
So for instance, `Area(mean)` and `Area(se)` are pairs of measurements created using multiple "sites" or "cross-sections" on one tumour. 
- Some other variables are labelled as *worst*, which may be either the `max` or `min` of such a set of "multi-site" tumour measurements.

### May the (data) Source be with you
It is important to note that these are (educated?) guesses; one is best off connecting with the person/agency that provided the data for a precise understanding of variables. This will prevent [nonsensical plots/models](https://sci-hub.ru/10.2307/2987563) and inferences from showing up in your work.

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

From @fig-cancer-area-mean-se, we see that the `area(mean)` and `area(se)` are somewhat correlated; moreover the correlation is slightly higher for the *malignant* tumours ( red dots, appropriately...). This trend shows up also for `radius` in @fig-cancer-radius-mean-se, and for `fractaldimension` in @fig-cancer-fractal-mean-se. However, for `smoothness`, we see much lower correlation {#fig-cancer-smoothness-mean-se}. 

For the `mean` vs `worst` scatter plots, we see decent correlations all around, with each of the graphs showing clouds tilted upward to the right.

### Simpson's Paradox
Try to remove colours and then plot a regression line. This usually gives a more clear idea of the correlation, without running into problems such as the [Simpson's Paradox](https://towardsdatascience.com/simpsons-paradox-and-interpreting-data-6a0443516765):

2. Try this dataset on School Expenditure and Grades. 

{{< downloadthis data/CASchools.csv dname="CASchools" label="Download the School Data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

3. Gas Prices and Consumption, described [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/OECDGas.html). Note the `log-transformed` Quant data...why do you reckon this was done in the data set itself?

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Scatter Plots, when they show "linear" clouds, tell us that there is some relationship between two Quant variables we have just plotted
- If so, then if one is the [target variable](https://orangedatamining.com/blog/machine-learning-jargon/) you are trying to [**design for**]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the other [independent, or controllable, variable](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/independent-and-dependent-variables/) is something you might want to [**design with**]{style="background: yellow;"}. 
- Always, always, plot and test your data! Both numerical summaries and graphical summaries are necessary! See below!!
