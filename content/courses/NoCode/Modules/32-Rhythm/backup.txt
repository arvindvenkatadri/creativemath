::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
### Using Orange

The Time Series Line Chart widget in Orange is described here. <https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/time-series/line_chart/>

Let us take some Births related data and plot it in Orange. 

{{< downloadthis ../../../../materials/Data/US_births_2000_2014_SSA.csv dname="births" label="Download the US Births data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

And download the Line Chart workflow file for this data:

{{< downloadthis Orange/time-series.ows dname="time-series" label="Download the Time Series Line Chart Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

Note how we have two widgets for the Line Charts. More shortly. 

### Using RAWgraphs

### Using DataWrapper

We can use a built-in dataset to create a line chart for browser usage:

Note that DataWrapper again requires/uses data in wide format to create its Line Charts!!

### Quantitative Data

-   `year`, `month`, `date_of_month`: (int) Columns giving time information
-   `day-of_week`: (int) Additional Time information
-   `births`: (int) Total live births across the USA that day

:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data
None. Though we might covert `day_of_week` and `month` into Qual variables later. 
:::

Evenly spread `year`, `month`, `date_of_month` and `day_of_week` variables...the bumps are curious though, no? `day_of_week` is of course neat. `births` are numerical data and have a good spread with a [bimodal distribution](../22-Quantity/index.qmd#wait-but-why) distribution. Some numbers in the mid-range hardly occur at all...
So a premonition of some two-valued phenomenon here already. 


### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

::: callout-note
### Q1. What does the `births` data look like over the years?

![Births over the Years](../../../../materials/images/Orange/births-over-the-years.png){#fig-births-over-years}

Hmmm...very busy graph. The overall trend is a slight bump in births around 2007 and then a slow reduction in births. Large variations otherwise, which we need to see in finer detail on a magnified scale, *a folded scale*,  or by averaging. 

~~Converting `month` or `day_of_week` to categorical in the File Menu does not provide us with a way of separating the time series by month or weekday...sad.~~. We will be able to average over month, day_of_week to see what happens. 

:::

::: callout-note
### Q2. What do births look like averaged over `month`?

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/time-series-with-averaging.png)

This is good! We have converted the dataset to a timeseries, of course, and then added a `moving transform` widget, that allows us to take averages of `births` over weeks, months, or years. Play with this setting in the `moving transform` widget. 

We see that averaging i.e. $aggregating$ by *Month of year* clearly shows September as the month for the most number of births.

::: callout-note
### Q3. What do births look like averaged over `day_of_week`?

Here too with the `moving transform` widget, choosing `Day of Week` as the aggregating parameter, we see a dip in births over weekends.

:::


::: callout-important
### Folded Scale?
Look at the figure below.

![Aggregate over Days of Week](../../../../materials/images/Orange/Aggregate-births-week-of-year.png){#fig-aggregate-over-day-of-week}


It should be apparent that the line chart shows averages based on "Week of Year". What does that mean?

Imagine a carpenter's folding footrule:
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Metre_pliant_500px.png)


Imagine the entire time series stretched out and then folded over itself at intervals of a **week**. There will of course be overlapping data that represent data points for [the same week year after year.]{style="background: yellow;"} THAT is what goes into the averaging!

So we see that the weeks in September show the highest average birth numbers, which seems right!

:::

## {{< iconify teenyicons candle-chart-outline >}} Other Plots

Imagine that we follow this overlap routine and get the data by same-week-of-year, as before. We need not necessarily average that data; we can simply plot each (repeated) week's worth of data as a box plot. This results in an array of boxplots, one per week, and is called a *candlestick plot*. 
Clearly we can do this for months, weeks, and even days of the week. Here is what it looks like; it does not seem possible to create these with any of the tools we are currently using. 

![](images/candlestick.png){#fig-candlestick}
[As before](../28-Groups/index.qmd), the medians are the black lines across each boxplot, which is one for each *month*. Note that since the medians are towards the upper end of the boxplots, we can guess that the per-month distribution must be skewed to the left (lower than median values are less frequent).

If the Quantities that vary over time are not *continuous* but *discrete* values such as `high`, `medium`, and `low`,, a time-series heatmap is also a possibility. 

![](images/heatmap.png){#fig-time-series-heatmap}


Very arbitrarily slicing the birth numbers into three bins titled `high`, `fine`, and `low`, we can plot a heatmap like this. Orange does have a heatmap widget, however it seems suited to Machine Learning methods such as Clustering. We need to investigate its possibilities for time series.

Plot these as time series, and try getting historical data, or data on festivals or important occasions in specific cities.

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Line Charts show up functional relationships or overall trends in the data.
- They can be made less cluttered than the corresponding scatter plots, especially with averaging. 
- Seasonal cycles can also be spotted very easily.
- The X-axis need not necessarily be *time*: it can often be other (independent) variables, and the Y-axis plots the target/dependent variable. 
- However, we do encounter many things that vary over time: weather, wealth, No. of users or downloads of an app, hits to a webpage, customers at a supermarket, or population of animals or plants in a region.
- These are best represented by Line Charts
- As humans, we are also deeply interested in patterns of recurrence over time, and in forecasting for the future, using tech, and using say [Oracles](https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php/A_Point_of_Contact).
- Both these purposes are amply served by Line Charts.
