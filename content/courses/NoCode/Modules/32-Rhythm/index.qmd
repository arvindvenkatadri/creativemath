## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Line Plots take two separate Quant variables as inputs. Each of the
variables is mapped to a position, or coordinate: one for the X-axis,
and the other for the Y-axis. Each pair of *observations* from the two
Quant variables ( which would be in one row!) give us a `point`. All
this much is identical with the [Scatter Plot](../30-Change#index.qmd).

And here, the points are connected together and sometimes thrown away
altogether, leaving just the line.

Looking at the lines, we get a very *function-al* sense of the
variation: is it upward or downward? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it
periodic or seasonal...all these questions can be answered with Line
Charts.

::: callout-important
### When one variable is Time?

Line charts often have one variable as a *time* variable. In such case
the data is said to be a **time series**.

Any metric that is measured over regular time intervals forms a **time
series**. Analysis of Time Series is commercially important because of
industrial need and relevance, especially with respect to Forecasting
(Weather data, sports scores, population growth figures, stock prices,
demand, sales, supply...). For example, in the graph shown below are the
temperatures over time in two US cities:

### Using Orange

Let us at least look at this data in Orange, and import it into this
rather elaborate Orange Workflow:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
{{< downloadthis Orange/time-series.ows dname="TimeSeriesWorkflow" label="Download the Orange Time Series Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

{{< downloadthis rawGraphs/LineChart/RIAA-RevenuesPerMusicFormat.csv dname="MusicRevenueData" label="Download the RIAA Music Revenue data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}
:::

Import this into Orange and see...

![RIAA Revenues Data
Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/music-data-table.png){#fig-riaa-data-table}

@fig-riaa-data-table states that there are 432 data points, with 7
variables in the dataset; some missing data.

For now, the variables we need are :

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data

-   `Year`: (int) Year in which RIAA revenue was logged
-   `Value (For Charting)`: (int) Revenue in million USD We can ignore
    the rest for now, unless we plan to work more with this data, and
    need to know more. The other numerical data showing *billions* of
    USD are not easily decipherable, an example of data that is not
    documented well...
:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `Category`: (chr) Form of the Music released ( CD etc..)
:::

We need to first `form time series` from the dataset: we will choose the
`year-date` variable, and indicate that it starts on Jan 1, 1973:

### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/23-how-to-create-a-line-chart>

Here be dragons: DataWrapper wants the data in [*wide
format*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wide_and_narrow_data): each
`Format` of music needs to have its figures in a separate column!
`r emoji::emoji("facepalm")`. And this is not a data transformation that
we can achieve within DataWrapper. Bah.

We are probably better off plotting a regular scatter plot. Here too
there seem to be limitations because we are not able to colour the
series based on type of music `Format`.

#### The Shape of [~~You~~](https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8) Data

Never mind that silly song now.

As mentioned above, data can be in [wide or long
form](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wide_and_narrow_data). How does one
imagine this shape-shifting that seems needed now and then? Let's see.

::: callout-important
### Long Form and Wide Form Data

Several tools such as DataWrapper (and others, yes, I agree, even with
code, as we will see) need data transformed to a specific **shape**.
this is usually mandated by the "shape or geometry" we intend to use in
the visualization. We should now look at this *idea* of *shape* in data.
Consider the data tables below:

```{r}
#| label: fig-pivotting-data
#| echo: false

## Wide Form
set.seed(4)
df4 <- tibble(Product = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
              Power = runif(3), 
              Cost = runif(3),
              Harmony = runif(3),
              Style = runif(3),
              Size = runif(3),
              Manufacturability = runif(3),
              Durability = runif(3),
              Universality = runif(3))
df4 %>% kbl()
## 
df4 %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -Product, names_to = "Parameter", values_to = "Rating") %>% kbl()

```

What we have done is:\

-   convert all the variable names into a stacked column `Parameter`\
-   Put all the numbers into another column `Rating`\
-   Repeated the `Product` column values as many times as needed to
    cover all `Parameter`s (8 times).\

See the gif below to get an idea of how this transformation can be
worked reversibly. (Yeah, never mind the code also.)

![Data
Pivoting](../../../../materials/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif){#fig-data-pivoting}

![Data Stacking in
RAWgraphs](../../../../materials/images/rawgraphs-pivot.png){#fig-rawgraphs-stacking}
{{< downloadthis rawGraphs/LineChart/RIAA-RevenuesPerMusicFormat.csv dname="MusicRevenueData" label="Download the RIAA Music Revenue data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}
:::

So how can we actually do this? Two Ways.

Turns out there are some nice people at U. San Diego who have built an
R-oriented app called [Radiant for Business
Analytics](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/about.html) that can do
this pretty much click-and-point style, though it is nowhere as much fun
as Orange. Head off there:\

<https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant>

We upload our original data, pivot it, and download the pivotted data.
Now the pivotted wide-form data should work in DataWrapper.

And RAWgraphs also has a `stack on column` option that does pretty much
the same thing. See here:
<https://www.rawgraphs.io/learning/how-to-stack-your-unstacked-data-or-meet-the-unpivoter>

Whatever, peasants.

We should take the first column `time_hour` and see if we can use that
as our time variable. All the weather related numerical data columns are
individual *time series* which we can plot and analyse.

### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

    measurement of weather parameters
-   `humid`,`temp`,`wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`,

### Question

Q1. What is Temperature `temp` over time at each of three airports?
![NYC Airport Temperatures over
Time](../../../../materials/images/Orange/weather-nyc-airports-temp.png){#fig-weather-nyc-airports-temp}

This is a Scatter Plot of course. 

It seems the `Line Chart` widget in Orange cannot colour individual
time series by colour using another Qualitative variable.
`r emoji::emoji("cry")`. Is there a better way? (You know the answer.)

Also note the utter busy-ness of this chart. This is a chart of 26K
points, well beyond what we can digest at one time. We need to
summarize/average etc.
:::

::: callout-note
### Question

Q2. In the US, there is a lot of talk of "wind chill factor". So, is
there some graphical evidence of windchill? (`temp` and `wind_speed`)?

![NYC Airport Temperatures over
Time](../../../../materials/images/Orange/temp-vs-windspeed.png){#fig-temp-vs-windspeed}
:::

::: callout-note
### Question

Q3. How do averaged plots look like, for `temp`, `humid`, and
`dewpoint`?

We can use the [`Moving Transform`
widget](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/time-series/moving_transform_w/)
in Orange to calculate monthly averages for these quantities, **after**
converting the data into a **time series**.

![Time Averaged Weather
Plots-3](../../../../materials/images/Orange/weather-averaged-plots.png){#fig-time-average-plot-1}
:::

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

-   There is a strong natural seasonal trend over the period of one year
    in the temperature at all three airports
-   If we plot `temperature` against `windspeed`, we see a fair negative
    slope/correlation, as we would expect.
-   Humidity is high most times, except during some very dry winter
    months?

::: callout-note
Did you notice the serious outlier in the temp vs windspeed graph? Try
to remove the `Select Rows` widget and see if you can spot it. Do you
understand why that egregious reading had to be be filtered?\
Such readings are called *outliers*.

None. Though we might covert `day_of_week` and `month` into Qual

:::

Evenly spread `year`, `month`, `date_of_month` and `day_of_week`
variables...the bumps are curious though, no? `day_of_week` is of course
neat. `births` are numerical data and have a good spread with a [bimodal
distribution](../22-Quantity/index.qmd#wait-but-why) distribution. Some
numbers in the mid-range hardly occur at all... So a premonition of some
two-valued phenomenon here already.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

::: callout-note
### Q1. What does the `births` data look like over the years?

![Births over the
Years](../../../../materials/images/Orange/births-over-the-years.png){#fig-births-over-years}

Hmmm...very busy graph. The overall trend is a slight bump in births
around 2007 and then a slow reduction in births. Large variations
otherwise, which we need to see in finer detail on a magnified scale, *a
folded scale*, or by averaging.

~~Converting `month` or `day_of_week` to categorical in the File Menu
does not provide us with a way of separating the time series by month or
weekday...sad.~~. We will be able to average over month, day_of_week to
see what happens.
:::

::: callout-note
### Q2. What do births look like averaged over `month`?

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/time-series-with-averaging.png)

This is good! We have converted the dataset to a timeseries, of course,
and then added a `moving transform` widget, that allows us to take
averages of `births` over weeks, months, or years. Play with this
setting in the `moving transform` widget.

We see that averaging i.e. $aggregating$ by *Month of year* clearly
shows September as the month for the most number of births.
:::

::: callout-note
### Q3. What do births look like averaged over `day_of_week`?

Here too with the `moving transform` widget, choosing `Day of Week` as
the aggregating parameter, we see a dip in births over weekends.
Try!!
:::

::: callout-important
### Folded Scale?

Look at the figure below.

![Aggregate over Week of the Year](../../../../materials/images/Orange/Aggregate-births-week-of-year.png){#fig-aggregate-over-week-of-year}

It should be apparent that the line chart shows averages based on "Week
of Year". What does that mean?

Imagine a carpenter's folding footruler:
![Carpenter's Footruler](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Metre_pliant_500px.png)

Imagine the entire time series stretched out and then folded over itself
at intervals of a **week**. There will of course be overlapping data
that represent data points for [the same week year after
year.]{style="background: yellow;"} THAT is what goes into the
averaging!

So we see that the weeks in September show the highest average birth
numbers, which seems right!
:::

## {{< iconify teenyicons candle-chart-outline >}} Other Plots

Imagine that we follow this overlap routine and get the data by
same-week-of-year, as before. We need not necessarily average that data;
we can simply plot each (repeated) week's worth of data as a box plot.
This results in an array of boxplots, one per week, and is called a
*candlestick plot*. Clearly we can do this for months, weeks, and even
days of the week. Here is what it looks like; it does not seem possible
to create these with any of the tools we are currently using.

![](images/candlestick.png){#fig-candlestick}

[As before](../28-Groups/index.qmd), the medians are the black lines
across each boxplot, which is one for each *month*. Note that since the
medians are towards the upper end of the boxplots, we can guess that the
per-month distribution must be skewed to the left (lower than median
values are less frequent).

If the Quantities that vary over time are not *continuous* but
*discrete* values such as `high`, `medium`, and `low`,, a time-series
heatmap is also a possibility.

![](images/heatmap.png){#fig-time-series-heatmap}

Very arbitrarily slicing the birth numbers into three bins titled
`high`, `fine`, and `low`, we can plot a heatmap like this. Orange does
have a heatmap widget, however it seems suited to Machine Learning
methods such as Clustering.

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

-   Line Charts show up functional relationships or overall trends in
    the data.
-   They can be made less cluttered than the corresponding scatter
    plots, especially with averaging.
-   Seasonal cycles can also be spotted very easily.
-   The X-axis need not necessarily be *time*: it can often be other
    (independent) variables, and the Y-axis plots the target/dependent
    variable.
-   However, we do encounter many things that vary over time: weather,
    wealth, No. of users or downloads of an app, hits to a webpage,
    customers at a supermarket, or population of animals or plants in a
    region.
-   These are best represented by Line Charts
-   As humans, we are also deeply interested in patterns of recurrence
    over time, and in forecasting for the future, using tech, and using
    say
    [Oracles](https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php/A_Point_of_Contact).
-   Both these purposes are amply served by Line Charts.
