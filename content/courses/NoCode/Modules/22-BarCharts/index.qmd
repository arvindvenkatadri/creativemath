## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Bar and Column Charts are used to show "counts" and "tallies" with respect to Qual variables. For instance, in a survey, how many people vs Gender? In a Target Audience survey on *Weekly Consumption*, how many low, medium, or high expenditure people?

Each Qual variable potentially has many levels as we saw in the [Nature of Data](../01-NatureofData/index.qmd#what-are-data-types). For instance, in the above example on Weekly Expenditure, `low`, `medium` and `high` were levels for the Qual variable `Expenditure`. Bar and Column charts perform internal **counts** for each *level* of the Qual variable under consideration. The Bar Plot is then a set of *disjoint* bars representing these counts; see the icon above, and then that for histograms!! The X-axis is the set of *levels* in the Qual variable, and the Y-axis represents the counts for each level.

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
### Using Orange

The Bar Plot widget in Orange is described here. <https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/barplot/>


{{< downloadthis data/banned-author-title.csv dname="banned" label="Download the Banned Books data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

And download the Bar Chart workflow file for this data:

{{< downloadthis orange/barchart-banned-books.ows dname="banned-bar-chart" label="Download the Bar Chart Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

### Using RAWgraphs

### Using DataWrapper

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: Banned Books in the USA

Here is a dataset from Jeremy Singer-Vine's blog, [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/). This is a list of all books banned in schools across the US.

Download this data to your machine and use it in Orange.

{{< downloadthis data/banned-author-title.csv dname="banned.csv" label="Download the Banned Books data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

![Banned Books Data Table](images/banned.png){#fig-banned-books-data-table}

![Banned Books Data Summary](images/banned-summary.png){#fig-summary-1}


@fig-banned-books-data-table states that we have 1586 rows, 7 columns. So 1586 banned books are on this list! `r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")` `r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")` `r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")`

The @fig-summary-1 already has a thumbnail-like bar chart. We will still make a "proper" one with the appropriate widget.

::: callout-warning
In the workflow below, note how it is still the **Distributions** widget that gives the Bar Chart. This is unfortunate, since we have been at pains to state how a Bar Chart and the Histogram deal with different types of variables (Qual and Quant respectively). Just one of those things we need to get used to!!

### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data

-   `Date of Challenge`: Date the book was (selected to be?) banned
:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `Author`: (text) Meta Data. Can be treated as Qual
-   `Title`: (text) Meta Data. Can be treated as Qual
-   `State`: (text) Qual factor
-   `District`: (text) Qual factor
-   `Type of Ban`: (text) Qual factor
-   `Origin of Challenge`: (text) Who requested the Ban?

How many levels in each?? Find out in Orange!!

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

::: callout-note
Q1. Which is the US state that bans the most? Which state is least involved in banning books? What can you say of the "geography of book banning" based on your understanding of the US of A? `r emoji::emoji("laugh")`

![Banned Books Count by State](../../../../materials/images/Orange/banned-books-bar-chart.png){#fig-bar-chart-1}

:::

::: callout-note
Q2. Create Bar charts of the count of banned books by Reason for Banning!!
:::

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

-   @fig-bar-chart-1 says that Texas is the worst at book banning!
-   Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas, Indiana,..are next in line
-   Is there a "Bible Belt" story here?

![Bible Belt](../../../../materials/images/BibleBelt.png){#fig-bible-belt}

-   And what, [Californians](https://youtu.be/JU01v6Ziz1A) are too busy making money to care about book-banning!!! The state does not even show up in the chart! `r emoji::emoji("laugh")`

```{r}
#| label: data download
#| echo: false
airbnb <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/1_OneNum.csv", header=TRUE)

apartments <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/2_TwoNum.csv", header=T, sep=",") %>% select(GrLivArea, SalePrice)

```

1.  AiRbnb Price Data on the French Riviera:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
airbnb %>% download_this(output_name = "airbnb",output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "AiRbnb data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")
```

1.  Apartment price vs ground living area:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
apartments %>% download_this(output_name = "apartments", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Apartment Data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save",   class = "hvr-sweep-to-left")

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

-   Always ~~count your chickens~~ count your data before you model or infer!
-   Counts first give you an absolute sense of how much data you have.
-   Counts by different Qual variables give you a sense of the **combinations** you have in your data: $(Male/Female) * (Income-Status) * (Old/Young) * (Urban/Rural)$ (Say 2 \* 3 \* 2 \* 2 = 24 combinations of data)
-   Counts then give an idea whether your data is lop-sided: do you have too many observations of one category(level) and too few of another category(level) in a given Qual variable?
-   Balance is important in order to draw decent inferences
-   And for ML algorithms, to train them properly.
