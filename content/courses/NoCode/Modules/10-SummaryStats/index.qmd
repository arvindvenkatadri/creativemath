## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration(s)!

First, some baseball:

{{< video https://youtu.be/PlKDQqKh03Y >}}

And then, an example from a more sombre story:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-table-1
literacy <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/US_literacy_SETables.xlsx",sheet = "S1",skip = 3) %>% 
  select(-c(2,3),-contains("S.E.")) %>% 
  rename("Numbers" = `...1`,
         "BelowLevel1" = `Estimate...4`,
         "Level1" = `Estimate...6`,
         "Level2" = `Estimate...8`,
         "Level3" = `Estimate...10`,
         "Level4/5" = `Estimate...12`) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(pattern = "Number",Numbers))

literacy %>% 
  kbl(caption = "US Population: Reading and Numeracy Levels", digits = 2,
      align = "c",centering = T,
      col.names = c("Year", "Below Level #1", "Level #1", "Level #2", "Level #3", "Levels #4 and #5")) %>% 
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Noto") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), position = "float_right") %>% 
  column_spec(2:4, bold = T) %>%
  row_spec(1:2, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#D7261E") %>% 
    footnote(general = "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), U.S. PIAAC 2017, U.S. PIAAC 2012/2014.")
```

This ghastly-looking @tbl-table-1 examines U.S. adults with low English literacy and numeracy skills—or low-skilled adults—at two points in the 2010s, in the years 2012/20141 and 2017, using data from the Program for the [International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)](https://gpseducation.oecd.org/Home). As can be seen the summary table is quite surprising in absolute terms, for a developed country like the US, and the numbers have *increased* from 2012/2014 to 2017!

So why do we need to summarise data? Summarization is an act of *throwing away data to make more sense*, as stated by [@stigler2016] and in the movie by [Brad Pitt aka Billy Beane](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/70201437). To summarize is to understand. Add to that the fact that our [Working Memories can hold maybe 7 items](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two).

And if we don't summarise? [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jorge_Luis_Borges), in a fantasy short story published in 1942, titled [“Funes the Memorious,”](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Borges_FunesTheMemorious.pdf) he described a man, Ireneo Funes, who found after an accident that he could remember absolutely everything. He could reconstruct every day in the smallest detail, and he could even later reconstruct the reconstruction, but he was incapable of understanding. Borges wrote, “To think is to **forget details, generalize, make abstractions**. In the teeming world of Funes there were only details.” (emphasis mine)

Aggregation can yield great gains above the individual components in data. Funes was big data without Statistics.

## {{< iconify fe beginner >}} What graphs / numbers will we see today?

| Variable #1 | Variable #2 |       Chart Names        |                                                                             "Chart Shape"                                                                              |

Before we plot a single chart, it is wise to take a look at several numbers that summarize the dataset under consideration. What might these be? Some obviously useful numbers are:

-   Dataset length: How many rows/observations?
-   Dataset breadth: How many columns/variables?
-   How many Quant variables?
-   How many Qual variables?
-   Quant variables: min, max, mean, median, sd
-   Qual variables: levels, counts per level
-   Both: means, medians for each level of a Qual variable...

## {{< iconify tabler variable >}} What kind of Data Variables will we choose?

::: column-page-inset-right
```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
read_csv("../../../../materials/Data/pronouns.csv") %>% 
  #filter(No == "1") %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped","hover","responsive"), full_width = T)
  
```
:::

We will obviously choose *all* variables in the dataset, unless they are unrelated ones such as `row number` or `ID` which (we think) may not contribute any information and we can disregard.

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Summaries Work?

Inspecting the `min`, `max`,`mean`, `median` and `sd` of each of the Quant variables tells us straightaway what the ranges of the variables are, and if there are some outliers, which could be normal, or maybe due to data entry error! Comparing two Quant variables for their ranges also tells us that we may have to $scale/normalize$ them for computational ease, if one variable has large numbers and the other has very small ones.

With Qual variables, we understand the `levels` within each, and understand the total number of combinations of the levels across these. `Counts` across levels, and across combinations of levels tells us whether the data has sufficient readings for graphing, inference, and decision-making, of if certain levels/classes of data are under or over represented. This may point to data gathering errors, which may be fixable, or you may have to decide in what to do with this data sparseness.

For both types of variables, we need to keep an eye open for data entries that are *missing*! We will have to take a decision to let go of that entire observation (i.e. a row) or do what is called *imputation* to fill in values that are based on the other values in the same column.
