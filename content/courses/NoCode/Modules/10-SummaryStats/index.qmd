## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration(s)!

First, some baseball:

{{< video https://youtu.be/PlKDQqKh03Y >}}

And then, an example from a more sombre story:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-table-1
literacy <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/US_literacy_SETables.xlsx",sheet = "S1",skip = 3) %>% 
  select(-c(2,3),-contains("S.E.")) %>% 
  rename("Numbers" = `...1`,
         "BelowLevel1" = `Estimate...4`,
         "Level1" = `Estimate...6`,
         "Level2" = `Estimate...8`,
         "Level3" = `Estimate...10`,
         "Level4/5" = `Estimate...12`) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(pattern = "Number",Numbers))

literacy %>% 
  kbl(caption = "US Population: Reading and Numeracy Levels", digits = 2,
      align = "c",centering = T,
      col.names = c("Year", "Below Level #1", "Level #1", "Level #2", "Level #3", "Levels #4 and #5")) %>% 
  kable_paper(full_width = F, html_font = "Noto") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), position = "float_right") %>% 
  column_spec(2:4, bold = T) %>%
  row_spec(1:2, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#D7261E") %>% 
    footnote(general = "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), U.S. PIAAC 2017, U.S. PIAAC 2012/2014.")
```

This ghastly-looking @tbl-table-1 examines U.S. adults with **low English literacy and numeracy skills**—or low-skilled adults—at two points in the 2010s, in the years 2012/20141 and 2017, using data from the Program for the [International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)](https://gpseducation.oecd.org/Home). As can be seen the summary table is quite surprising in absolute terms, for a developed country like the US, and the numbers have *increased* from 2012/2014 to 2017!

So why do we need to summarise data? Summarization is an act of *throwing away data to make more sense*, as stated by [@stigler2016] and also in the movie by [Brad Pitt aka Billy Beane](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/70201437). **To summarize is to understand**. Add to that the fact that our [Working Memories can hold maybe 7 items](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two), so it means information retention too.

And if we don't summarise? [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jorge_Luis_Borges), in a fantasy short story published in 1942, titled [“Funes the Memorious,”](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Borges_FunesTheMemorious.pdf) he described a man, Ireneo Funes, who found after an accident that he could remember absolutely everything. He could reconstruct every day in the smallest detail, and he could even later reconstruct the reconstruction, but he was incapable of understanding. Borges wrote, “To think is to **forget details, generalize, make abstractions**. In the teeming world of Funes, there were only details.” (emphasis mine)

Aggregation can yield great gains above the individual components in data. Funes was big data without Statistics.

## {{< iconify fe beginner >}} What graphs / numbers will we see today?

| Variable #1 | Variable #2 |       Chart Names        |                                                                             "Chart Shape"                                                                              |

Before we plot a single chart, it is wise to take a look at several numbers that summarize the dataset under consideration. What might these be? Some obviously useful numbers are:

-   Dataset length: How many rows/observations?
-   Dataset breadth: How many columns/variables?
-   How many Quant variables?
-   How many Qual variables?
-   Quant variables: min, max, mean, median, sd
-   Qual variables: levels, counts per level
-   Both: means, medians for each level of a Qual variable...

## {{< iconify tabler variable >}} What kind of Data Variables will we choose?

::: column-page-inset-right
```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
read_csv("../../../../materials/Data/pronouns.csv") %>% 
  #filter(No == "1") %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(c("striped","hover","responsive"), full_width = T)
  
```
:::

We will obviously choose *all* variables in the dataset, unless they are unrelated ones such as `row number` or `ID` which (we think) may not contribute any information and we can disregard.

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Summaries Work?

**Quant variables**: Inspecting the `min`, `max`,`mean`, `median` and `sd` of each of the Quant variables tells us straightaway what the ranges of the variables are, and if there are some outliers, which could be normal, or maybe due to data entry error! Comparing two Quant variables for their ranges also tells us that we may have to $scale/normalize$ them for computational ease, if one variable has large numbers and the other has very small ones.

**Qual variables**: With Qual variables, we understand the `levels` within each, and understand the total number of combinations of the levels across these. `Counts` **across levels, and across combinations of levels** tells us whether the data has sufficient readings for graphing, inference, and decision-making, of if certain levels/classes of data are under or over represented. 

**Together?**: We can use Quant and Qual together, to develop the above summaries (`min`, `max`,`mean`, `median` and `sd`) for Quant variables, again **across levels, and across combinations of levels** of single or multiple Quals, along with `counts` if we are interested in that. 


For both types of variables, we need to keep an eye open for data entries that are *missing*! This may point to data gathering errors, which may be fixable. Or we will have to take a decision to let go of that entire observation (i.e. a row). Or even do what is called *imputation* to fill in values that are based on the other values in the same column, which sounds like we are making up data, but isn't so really. 

And this may also tell us if we are witnessing a [Simpson's Paradox situation](../30-ScatterPlots/index.qmd#what-is-the-story-here-1).  You may have to decide on what to do with this data sparseness, or just check your biases!

## {{< iconify material-symbols table-chart-outline >}} {{< iconify tabler ruler-measure >}} {{< iconify material-symbols summarize-outline >}} Obtaining Quant Summaries

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using Orange
Let us examine a healthcare-related dataset in Orange, on heart disease. Download the Orange workflow by clicking on the icon below, and open it in Orange.

{{< downloadthis Orange/grouped-summaries.ows dname="grouped_summaries" label="Download the Orange Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

![Grouped Summaries](../../../../materials/images/Orange/grouped-summaries.png){#fig-grouped-summaries}

In @fig-grouped-summaries, we see two sub-windows: on the upper right, we see the output of "Group By" where we have selected `gender`. We can also in the window choose what summary statistics we wish to see for each of the *other* variables in the dataset.
To the lower left, we see the output of the *`Grouped Summaries` Data Table*, which shows just two rows: one for gender::female, and another for gender::male. All other variables have been summarised as desired. 

Play with the summary output settings, and also with choosing which variable to `Group By`. Can you `Group By` more than one Qual variable?

Does Group By with a Quant variable make sense?

::: callout-note
### Grouping By Multiple Variables
~~There does not appear to be a way in which one can choose to Group By multiple variables as an input to summary...which does not seem possible in Orange, but *is* a breeze with R or Python or...stuff which you peasants will not touch.~~
Use `CMD` and the `Windows` key respectively to select two or more `Group By` variables. Hmph!

## {{< iconify fa6-brands kaggle >}} Dataset: Penguins

Let us use a (now) well-known data set on penguins. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>% download_this(output_name = "penguins", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Penguins data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")

```


Download this data into your Orange work folder and then use it in Orange. 


### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

Here is the Data Table for the `penguins` data:

![Penguins Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/penguins-data-table.png){#fig-penguins-data-table}

We see from @fig-penguins-data-table that there are 344 observations (i.e. individual penguins) and 6 variables. There is some missing data but not too much!

### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary

### Qualitative Data
- `sex`: male and female penguins
- `island`: they have **islands** to themselves!!
- `species`: Three adorable types!

::: {.column-margin}

:::

:::


::: callout-note
### Quantitative Data
- `bill_length_mm`: The length of the penguins' bills
- `bill_depth_mm`: See the picture!!
- `flipper_length_mm`: Flippers! Penguins have "hands"!!
- `body_mass_gm`: Grams? Grams??? Why, these penguins are like human babies!!`r emoji::emoji("heart")`

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Summary Figures and Tables.

::: callout-note
Q1. What are the `mean` weights of the penguins, for each `species`?
In Orange, we do a `Group By` with the `species` variable, and select *mean* for the **summary function** for the variable `body_mass_gm. 

::: callout-note
For now, disable summaries for everything else to avoid clutter!

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

- From @fig-penguins-summaries-1, clearly `Gentoo` penguins are the big brothers/sisters here, with a mean body mass higher by around 1250 grams!!`r emoji::emoji("laugh")`

- From @fig-penguins-summaries-2: 
  - Hmm..Chinstrap penguins are fewer in number, compared to the other two species. 
  - `flipper_lengths_mm` are pretty much ballpark same across all `species` and `sex` combinations; `Gentoo` still dominates the `body_mass_gm` across both.
  - `female` `Gentoo` are heavier (on average) than other `male`-s even!!`r emoji::emoji("muscle")` (*Not* necessarily on individual basis!!). 

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

1. Try adding more *summary functions* to the summary table? Which might you choose? Why?

1. Try your hand at these datasets. Look at the data table, state the data dictionary, contemplate a few Research Questions and answer them with Summaries and Tables in Orange!

::: callout-note
### Star Trek Books\
```{r echo=FALSE}

library(rtrek)
star_trek_books <- stBooks
star_trek_books %>% download_this(output_name = "star_trek_books", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Start Trek Book data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")

```

Which would be the `Group By` variables here? And what would you summarize? With which function?

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Data Summaries give you the essentials, without getting bogged down in the details(just yet).\
- Summaries help you **"live with your data"**; this is an important step in understanding it, and deciding what to do with it.\
- Summaries help evoke Questions and Hypotheses, which may lead to inquiries, analysis, and insights\
