## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration

![ScatterPlot Inspiration <http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/archive/?c=559>](images/Evolution-belief-vs-GDP.jpeg){#fig-scatterplot-inspiration}

Does *belief in Evolution* depend upon the GSP of of the country?
Where is the US in all of this? Does the [Bible Belt](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-bible-belt-1434529) tip the scales here?

And India?

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?
Scatter Plots take two separate Quant variables as inputs. Each of the variables is mapped to a position, or coordinate: one for the X-axis, and the other for the Y-axis. Each pair of *observations* from the two Quant variables ( which would be in one row!) give us a `point` in the Scatter Plot. 

Looking at these *clouds of points* gives us an intuitive sense of the relationship between the two Quant variables, how one varies with the other. A cloud that slopes upward to the right indicates a *positive* relationship between the two; a cloud that slopes down to the right indicates a *negative* one. An amorphous cloud that does not discernibly slope in either way would lead us to infer that there is little or no relationship between the variables. 


::: callout-important
## Slope and the Correlation Coefficient are Related
Under the assumption of a *linear relationship* between the two Quant variables, we plot a straight trend line, or **regression line** through the cloud of points, as a line that best represents that linear relationship. The **slope** of the regression line is directly linked to the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** between the two variables.

## {{< iconify ph chart-scatter-bold  >}} Plotting a Scatter Plot

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using Orange

We can use the now (overly) familiar `iris` dataset to plot our first scatter plot. Download the workflow file below:

{{< downloadthis orange/scatter.ows dname="scatter" label="Download the Scatter Plot Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

![Iris Scatter Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/iris-scatter-plot.png){#fig-iris-scatter-plot}


- Try setting shapes and colours, and try plotting a "regression line". Do you get one line, or several? Why, or why not? How can you switch between the two "methods"?
- Try other pairs of Quant variables in the dataset. 
- Which plot is the *most informative*? Why?


### Using RAWgraphs

<https://youtu.be/FafXHMmau1M>


### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/65-how-to-create-a-scatter-plot>

:::

## What is the Story here?
- There are three species of iris flowers and they are "separable" based on combinations of their quantitative measurements. 
- Some pairs of Quant variables create Scatter Plots that are quite *disjoint* and allow easy identification of the `species` variable.
- In a ML model for this dataset, the `species` variable is most likely to be the `target variable` while the rest are `predictors`. 



## {{< iconify game-icons sad-crab >}} Dataset: Cancer

Let us examine a fairly complex dataset pertaining to cancer, and analyze that with scatter plots.

{{< downloadthis data/cancer.csv dname="cancer" label="Download the Cancer dataset" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

We can use the same Workflow as before. 

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

![Cancer Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-data-table.png){#fig-cancer-data-table}


From @fig-cancer-data-table, we see that there is *one* Qual column `Diagnosis`, and all the remaining 31 columns seem to be some Quant measurements of a total of 569 tumours. (Not all columns are visible)

![Cancer Data Summary Table #1](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-summary-table.png){#fig-cancer-data-summary}


@fig-cancer-data-summary gives is histograms and statistics of all the 32 columns. Most histograms seem roughly symmetric, but a detailed look must be taken. 

![Cancer Data Summary Table #2](../../../../materials/images/Orange/cancer-summary-table-2.png){#fig-cancer-data-summary-2}

In @fig-cancer-data-summary-2, we see that there is some imbalance between the *counts* for the one Qual variable, `Diagnosis`.

:::
- Many of the Quant variables seem to be `mean` measurements, with the mean presumably taken over several "sites" within the same tumour. 
- Along with the `mean`, there are also measurements of `se` or *standard error* which is, roughly speaking, a measure of the `standard deviation` of the multiple measurements made. 
So for instance, `Area(mean)` and `Area(se)` are pairs of measurements created using multiple "sites" or "cross-sections" on one tumour. 
- Some other variables are labelled as *worst*, which may be either the `max` or `min` of such a set of "multi-site" tumour measurements.

### May the (data) Source be with you
It is important to note that these are (educated?) guesses; one is best off connecting with the person/agency that provided the data for a precise understanding of variables. This will prevent [nonsensical plots/models](https://sci-hub.ru/10.2307/2987563) and inferences from showing up in your work.

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

From @fig-cancer-area-mean-se, we see that the `area(mean)` and `area(se)` are somewhat correlated; moreover the correlation is slightly higher for the *malignant* tumours ( red dots, appropriately...). This trend shows up also for `radius` in @fig-cancer-radius-mean-se, and for `fractaldimension` in @fig-cancer-fractal-mean-se. However, for `smoothness`, we see much lower correlation {#fig-cancer-smoothness-mean-se}. 

For the `mean` vs `worst` scatter plots, we see decent correlations all around, with each of the graphs showing clouds tilted upward to the right.

### Simpson's Paradox
Try to remove colours and then plot a regression line. This usually gives a more clear idea of the correlation, without running into problems such as the [Simpson's Paradox](https://towardsdatascience.com/simpsons-paradox-and-interpreting-data-6a0443516765):

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

1. Try to play this online [Correlation Game](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/correlation_game/)

2. Try this dataset on School Expenditure and Grades. 

{{< downloadthis data/CASchools.csv dname="CASchools" label="Download the School Data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

3. Gas Prices and Consumption, described [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/OECDGas.html). Note the `log-transformed` Quant data...why do you reckon this was done in the data set itself?

{{< downloadthis data/OECDGas.csv dname="OECDGas" label="Download the Gas Consumption Data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

4. Horror Movies ( oh, you awful people..)

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Scatter Plots, when they show "linear" clouds, tell us that there is some relationship between two Quant variables we have just plotted
- If so, then if one is the [target variable](https://orangedatamining.com/blog/machine-learning-jargon/) you are trying to [**design for**]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the other [independent, or controllable, variable](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/independent-and-dependent-variables/) is something you might want to [**design with**]{style="background: yellow;"}. 
- Always, always, plot and test your data! Both numerical summaries and graphical summaries are necessary! See below!!
