## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Box Plots are an extremely useful data visualization that gives us an idea of the distribution of a Quant variable, for each *level* of another Qual variable. The internal process of this plot is as follows:

  - make groups of the Quant variable for each level of the Qual
  - in each group, rank the Quant variable values in increasing order
  - Calculate: `median`, `IQR`, `outliers`
  - plot these as a vertical or horizontal box structure

The box  can also be asymmetric "half plots" if needed...

::: callout-note
### Histograms and Box Plots
Note how the histogram that dwells upon the `mean` and `standard deviation`, whereas the boxplot focuses on the `median` and `quartiles`.
The former uses the *values* of the Quant variable, whereas the latter uses their *sequence number* or *ranks*. 
:::

Box plots are often used for example in HR operations to understand Salary distributions across grades of employees. Marks of students in competitive exams are also declared using Quartiles. 

![Box Plot and Density](../../../../materials/images/Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg){#fig-boxplot-density}

In the @fig-boxplot-density, the boxplot is compared with a *density plot*, which shows a **symmetric** normal density. Since the latter is symmetric, the `median` and the `mean` are identical, as seen by the correspondence with the boxplot in the figure above.

Box Plot Discussions

:::


In the @fig-three-boxplots, we see the difference between boxplots that show *symmetric* and *skewed* distributions. The "lid" and the "bottom" of the box are not of similar width in distributions with significant skewness. 

Compare these with the corresponding @fig-distribution-skewness.

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using Orange
Here is the [BoxPlot Widget description](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/boxplot/).

Let us first plot a set of boxplots for the familiar `iris` dataset and then investigate other datasets using the same Orange workflow. 

{{< downloadthis orange/boxplots.ows dname="boxplots" label="Download the BoxPlot Workflow file" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

![Iris Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/iris-boxplot-light.png){#fig-iris-boxplot}

@fig-iris-boxplot shows the three horizontal box-plots for the chosen Quant variable, one for each *level* of `iris`(species). The IQR is also shown for each fo the groups. One can selectively compare either medians or means across these groups of measurements. 


### Using RAWgraphs

### Using DataWrapper

There does not seem to be a way of creating Box Plots in DataWrapper .

## {{< iconify uiw pay >}} Dataset: Salaries in Academia

Let us examine this dataset in Orange.

{{< downloadthis data/salaries.csv dname="salaries" label="Download the Salaries data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

![Salaries Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-data-table.png){#fig-salaries-data-table}

@fig-salaries-data-table states that there are 397 teachers, with 6 variables in the dataset.

### Quantitative Data

-   `salary`: (int) (Annual) Salary!
-   `yrs_service`: (int) No. of Years they have served as teachers
-   `yrs_since_phd`: (int) No. of Years after their PhD. (sigh)

:::

::: callout-note
### Qualitative Data

-   `discipline`: (chr) Nature of Expertise
-   `rank`: (chr) Nature of Appointment
-   `sex`: (chr) Male / Female. Note the imbalance in the counts!!

### Qual and Quant...
Can any of the Quant variables be thought of as *Quant* variables? When, under what circumstances?

:::

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Box Plots and Violins

::: callout-note
## Question
Q1. What is the distribution of `salary`? If we split by `sex`?

::: {#fig-netflix-histograms layout-ncol=2}

![Salaries Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-boxplot-single.png){#fig-salaries-boxplot}


![Salaries Box Plot by Sex](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-boxplot-by-sex.png){#fig-salaries-by-sex}

Salaries Data Box Plots

:::

:::

::: callout-note
## Question
Q2. What is the distribution of `salary`, when we split by other Qual variables, such as `rank`?

![Salaries Box Plot by Sex](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-by-rank.png){#fig-salaries-by-rank}

:::


### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

Salaries have quite a wide distribution with some very highly paid individuals ( ~ $240K), while the median is still $107K. So some people are more than 2X the median!

When split by `sex`, we get *two* box plots that show the differences between group salaries. The means and medians are quite different between the two groups, an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical t-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}. 

When split by `rank``, we get *three* box plots that show the differences between group salaries, again an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical ANOVA test*]{style="background: yellow;"}. 

## {{< iconify ic outline-gpp-good>}} Are the Differences Significant?

::: callout-important
## t-test for two categories
When comparing **mean** salaries vs sex in @fig-salaries-by-sex, note the annotation below the graph. This is the result of the [*t-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}:

$$ Student's ~ t: 3.198~(p = 0.002, ~ N = 397) $$

This indicates several things:

- That the `t-statistic` is 3.198;
- If we [**assume** `sex` makes no difference to `salary`]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is low $p = 0.002$;
- And of course that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate. 

The test states that this difference **is statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it. 
:::


::: callout-important
### ANOVA test for more than 2 levels
Now observe the boxplots and annotations in @fig-salaries-by-rank, where again we compare **mean** salaries vs `rank`. This is the result of the [*ANOVA-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}:

$$ ANOVA: ~ 128.217~~(p = 0.000, ~ N = 397) $$

This indicates several things:

- That the ANOVA `F-statistic` is 128.217;
- If we [**assume** `rank` makes no difference to `salary`]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is negligible $p = 0.000$;
- And again that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate.

The ANOVA test states that the (multiple) differences **are statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it. 

For the intrepid, here is a brief, diagrammed, and [intuitive explanation of ANOVA.](../../../Analytics/Inference/Modules/130-ThreeMeansOrMore/ANOVA.qmd#workflow-anova). Note that the `t-test` and `ANOVA` are identical tests, the former being used for 2-level comparisons of means, and the latter for comparisons of more than 2 means.

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

Here are a couple of datasets that you might want to analyze with box plots, and even perform `t-tests` and `ANOVA-tests`:

1. Insurance Data
{{< downloadthis data/insurance.csv dname="insurance" label="Download the Insurance data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}


1. Political Donations
{{< downloadthis data/donations.csv dname="donations" label="Download the Donations data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Box plots are a  powerful statistical graphic that give us a combined view of data ranges, quartiles, medians, and outliers. 
- Box plots can compare `groups` within our Quant variable, based on `levels` of a Qual variable.
- They are ideal for visualizing statistical tests for difference in *mean* values across groups (t-test and ANOVA).
- In your design research, you would have numerical Quant data that is accompanied by categorical Qual data pertaining to your target audience. Analysing for **differences** in the Quant across levels of the Qual is a vital step in justifying time, effort, and money for further actions in your project.
