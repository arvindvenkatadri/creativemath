## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration
![Box Plot Inspiration](images/what-we-mean-when-we-say.jpeg){#fig-boxplot-inspiration}

[Alice said, "I say what I mean and I mean what I say!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1abf1dg/comment/kjn85an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Are the rest of us so sure? What do we mean when we use any of the phrases above? How definite are we? There is a range of "sureness" and "unsureness"...and this is where we can use box plots like @fig-boxplot-inspiration to show that range of opinion.

Maybe it is time for a box plot on uh, shades[^2] of meaning for ~~Jane Austen~~ Gen-Z phrases! Bah.

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Box Plots are an extremely useful data visualization that gives us an idea of the distribution of a Quant variable, for each *level* of another Qual variable. The internal process of this plot is as follows:

  - make groups of the Quant variable for each level of the Qual
  - in each group, rank the Quant variable values in increasing order
  - Calculate: `median`, `IQR`, `outliers`
  - plot these as a vertical or horizontal box structure

The box  can also be asymmetric "half plots" if needed...

::: callout-note
### Histograms and Box Plots
Note how the histogram that dwells upon the `mean` and `standard deviation`, whereas the boxplot focuses on the `median` and `quartiles`.
The former uses the *values* of the Quant variable, whereas the latter uses their *sequence number* or *ranks*. 
:::

Box plots are often used for example in HR operations to understand Salary distributions across grades of employees. Marks of students in competitive exams are also declared using Quartiles. 

![Box Plot and Density](../../../../materials/images/Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg){#fig-boxplot-density}

In the @fig-boxplot-density, the boxplot is the one on the top. The *box* part represents the **middle 50%** of the data, in order of magnitude, and the two halves of the box are defined by the *median line*. 

The boxplot in the figure compared with a *density plot*, which shows a **symmetric** normal density. Since the latter is symmetric, the `median` and the `mean` are identical, as seen by the correspondence with the boxplot in the figure above. 


::: {#fig-boxplots-with-skewness layout-ncol=2}

![Box Plot and Skewness](../../../../materials/images/Boxplots_with_skewness.png){#fig-three-boxplots}


![Density and Skewness](../../../../materials/images/Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png){#fig-distribution-skewness}


Box Plot Discussions

:::


In the @fig-three-boxplots, we see the difference between boxplots that show *symmetric* and *skewed* distributions. The "lid" and the "bottom" of the box are not of similar width in distributions with significant skewness. 

Compare these with the corresponding @fig-distribution-skewness.


## {{< iconify carbon box-plot >}} {{< iconify carbon chart-violin-plot >}} Creating Box Plots

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using Orange
Here is the [BoxPlot Widget description](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/boxplot/).

Let us first plot a set of boxplots for the familiar `iris` dataset and then investigate other datasets using the same Orange workflow. 

{{< downloadthis orange/boxplots.ows dname="boxplots" label="Download the BoxPlot Workflow file" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

![Iris Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/iris-boxplot-light.png){#fig-iris-boxplot}

@fig-iris-boxplot shows the three horizontal box-plots for the chosen Quant variable, one for each *level* of `iris`(species). The IQR is also shown for each fo the groups. One can selectively compare either medians or means across these groups of measurements. 


### Using RAWgraphs

### Using DataWrapper

There does not seem to be a way of creating Box Plots in DataWrapper .

## {{< iconify uiw pay >}} Dataset: Salaries in Academia

Let us examine this dataset in Orange.

{{< downloadthis data/salaries.csv dname="salaries" label="Download the Salaries data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

![Salaries Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-data-table.png){#fig-salaries-data-table}

@fig-salaries-data-table states that there are 397 teachers, with 6 variables in the dataset.

### Qual and Quant...
Can any of the Quant variables be thought of as *Quant* variables? When, under what circumstances?

:::

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Box Plots and Violins

::: callout-note
## Question
Q1. What is the distribution of `salary`? If we split by `sex`?

::: {#fig-netflix-histograms layout-ncol=2}

![Salaries Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-boxplot-single.png){#fig-salaries-boxplot}

Salaries Data Box Plots

:::

:::

::: callout-note
## Question
Q2. What is the distribution of `salary`, when we split by other Qual variables, such as `rank`?

![Salaries Box Plot by Sex](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-by-rank.png){#fig-salaries-by-rank}

:::


### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

Salaries have quite a wide distribution with some very highly paid individuals ( ~ $240K), while the median is still $107K. So some people are paid than 2X the median!

When split by `sex`, we get *two* box plots that show the differences between group salaries. The means and medians are quite different between the two groups, an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical t-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}. 

When split by `rank`, we get *three* box plots that show the differences between group salaries, again an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical ANOVA test*]{style="background: yellow;"}. 

## {{< iconify ic outline-gpp-good>}} Are the Differences Significant?

::: callout-important
### Hunches and Hypotheses
In data analysis, we always want to know[^1], as in life, how important things are, whether they **matter**. To do this, we make up hunches, or more precisely, *Hypotheses*. We make two in fact: 

$H_0$: *Nothing is happening*;\
$H_a$: ("a" for Alternate): *Something is happening and it is important enough to pay attention to*. 

We then [***pretend*** that $H_0$ is true](https://youtu.be/ciS5GikZ5Jo){style="background: yellow;"} and ask that our data prove us wrong; if it does, *we reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_a$*. 

This is a very important idea of *Hypothesis Testing* which helps you justify your hunch. Try to do this for the [Package Opening and Closing Times](../22-Histograms/index.qmd#your-turn). 

:::

::: callout-important
## t-test for two categories
When comparing **mean** salaries vs sex in @fig-salaries-by-sex, note the annotation below the graph. This is the result of the [*t-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}:

$$ Student's ~ t: 3.198~(p = 0.002, ~ N = 397) $$

This indicates several things:

- That the `t-statistic` is 3.198;
- If we [**assume** `sex` makes no difference to `salary`]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is low $p = 0.002$;
- And of course that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate. 

The test states that this difference **is statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it. Look at the references below to get a fascinating history of statistical testing and its origins in ...beer. 
:::


::: callout-important
### ANOVA test for more than 2 levels
Now observe the boxplots and annotations in @fig-salaries-by-rank, where again we compare **mean** salaries vs `rank`. This is the result of the [*ANOVA-test*]{style="background: yellow;"}:

$$ ANOVA: ~ 128.217~~(p = 0.000, ~ N = 397) $$

This indicates several things:

- That the ANOVA `F-statistic` is 128.217;
- If we [**assume** `rank` makes no difference to `salary`]{style="background: yellow;"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is negligible $p = 0.000$;
- And again that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate.

The ANOVA test states that the (multiple) differences **are statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it.

## {{< iconify tdesign cat size = 2x >}} ANOVA for the Cat-egorically Curious
For the intrepid, here is a brief, diagrammed, hand-calculated, and intuitive [walk-through of ANOVA.](../../../Analytics/Inference/Modules/130-ThreeMeansOrMore/ANOVA.qmd#workflow-anova) Note that the `t-test` and `ANOVA` are identical tests, the former being used for 2-level comparisons of means, and the latter for comparisons of more than 2 means. 
Again, **means**, not **medians**. 

:::

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

Here are a couple of datasets that you might want to analyze with box plots, and even perform `t-tests` and `ANOVA-tests`:

1. Insurance Data
{{< downloadthis data/insurance.csv dname="insurance" label="Download the Insurance data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}


2. Political Donations
{{< downloadthis data/donations.csv dname="donations" label="Download the Donations data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

3. UFO Encounters
The data dictionary for this dataset is here at the [TidyTuesday Website.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-25)

(The TidyTuesday Website is a treasure trove of interesting datasets!)

```{r}
#| echo: false
ufo_sightings <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv")

ufo_sightings %>% download_this(output_name = "UFO", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "UFO Sighting data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")
```

4. GPT-based Language detectors are biased against non-native English writers.
```{r}
#| echo: false
detectors <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-18/detectors.csv")

detectors %>% download_this(output_name = "AI_Dectectors", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "AI Dectector data", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")

```

What story, and deduction can you tell from @fig-ai-detectors-are-biased ? How would you [replicate it](https://www.rawgraphs.io/learning/how-to-make-a-violin-plot)? What would you add?

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Box plots are a  powerful statistical graphic that give us a combined view of data ranges, quartiles, medians, and outliers. 
- Box plots can [compare `groups` within our Quant variable, based on `levels` of a Qual variable]{style="background: yellow;"}. This is a very common and important task in research! In your design research, you would have numerical Quant data that is accompanied by categorical Qual data pertaining to your target audience. Analyzing for **differences** in the Quant across levels of the Qual (e.g household expenditure across groups of people) is a vital step in justifying time, effort, and money for further actions in your project. Don't faff this. 
- They are ideal for visualizing statistical tests for difference in *mean* values across groups (t-test and ANOVA).
