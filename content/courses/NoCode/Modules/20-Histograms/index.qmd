## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

**Histograms** are best to show the distribution of a *quantitative variable*. A *distribution* shows how often the variable in question attains specific values. We plot the histogram by displaying the *how often* vs **defined ranges**, often called *buckets* or *bins*. For example, you can create histogram buckets from discrete ranges of the Quant variables, as 0-5, 6-10, 11-15...etc.

::: callout-important
As we will see shortly, **Bar/Column charts** show *categorical data*, such as the number of apples, bananas, carrots, etc. Visually speaking, histograms do not usually show spaces between buckets because these are *continuous values*, while column charts show spaces to separate each *category*. More later.

### Using Orange

Let us rapidly make some histograms in Orange, so that we know how the tool works here. We start with the `iris` dataset: Download this *Orange workflow* file and open it in Orange.

{{< downloadthis Orange/iris_histogram.ows dname="iris_histogram" label="Download the Histogram Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

You can see the effect of modifying the bin widths, and of fitting a standard distribution for comparison.


### Using RAWgraphs


### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/136-histogram-min-max-median-mean>

DataWrapper does not offer a separate histogram-making tool. Histograms in DataWrapper are available as a part of the data-inspection part of the work flow, as a small thumbnail-sized plot.

-   `Seasons`: (int) No. of Seasons
-   `Episodes`: (int) No. of Episodes
-   `IMDB_Rating`: (int) IMDB Rating!!
:::

### Qualitative Data

-   `Genere`: (chr) types of Genres
-   `Title`: (chr) 109 titles
-   `Subgenre`: (chr) types of sub-Genres

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Histograms.

::: callout-note
Q1. What is the distribution of `IMDB_Rating`? If we split/colour by movie `Genere`?

::: {#fig-netflix-histograms layout-ncol=2}

:::

::: callout-note
Q2. Are `IMDB_Rating` affected by the number of `Seasons` or `Episodes`?

::: {#fig-IMDB-Rating-vs-Seasons-Episodes layout-ncol=2}

![Reformatting "Seasons"](images/ReformatVariable.png){#fig-ReformatVariable} 

![IMDB Rating vs Seasons](images/IMDBvsSeason.png){#fig-IMDBvsSeason}

Plotting with `Seasons`

:::

We first need to reformat the `Seasons` variable from **N** to **C** in the data file view. This converts it to Qual. Then we split the IMDB histogram by this new variable.

:::

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

Most movies have decent IMDB scores; the distribution is left-skewed. Some of course have been trashed!! Splitting `IMDBRating` by `Genere` is not too illuminating...

Not much wisdom to be gleaned either from splitting `IMDBRating` by `Seasons`...

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: the Old Faithful geyser in the USA

Here is a dataset about the eruption durations, and wait times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, USA.

Download this data to your machine and import it into Orange.

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

-   Both durations have a "double-humped" distribution...
-   There are therefore two distinct ranges for both durations.
-   Are there two different mechanisms at work in the geyser, that randomly kick in?

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

Try your hand at these datasets. Look at the data table, state the data dictionary, contemplate a few Research Questions and answer them with graphs in Orange!

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

> Histograms are used to study the distribution of one or a few variables. Checking the distribution of your variables one by one is probably the first task you should do when you get a new dataset. It delivers a good quantity of information. Several distribution shapes exist, here is an illustration of the 6 most common ones:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Build dataset with different distributions

data <- data.frame(
  type = c( rep("edge peak", 1000), rep("comb", 1000), rep("normal", 1000), rep("uniform", 1000), rep("bimodal", 1000), rep("skewed", 1000) ),
  value = c( rnorm(900), rep(3, 100), rnorm(360, sd=0.5), rep(c(-1,-0.75,-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0.75), 80), rnorm(1000), runif(1000), rnorm(500, mean=-2), rnorm(500, mean=2), abs(log(rnorm(1000))) )
)

# Represent it
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=value)) +
    geom_histogram(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    facet_wrap(~type, scale="free_x") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      axis.title.x=element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
    )
```

In your Design-Project-related research, you will collect data from or about your target audience. The Quantitative parts of that data may obtain with any of these distributions. Inspecting these may give you an insight into the **population** of your target audience, something that may likely be true, a hunch, which you could verify and convert into ...opportunity.
