Golf Drive Distance over the years
:::

What do we see here? In about two-and-a-half decades, golf drive distances have increased, *on the average*, by 35 yards. 
The maximum distance has also gone up by 30 yards, and the minimum is now at 250 yards, which was close to average in 1983! What was a decent average in 1983 is just the bare minimum in 2017!!

Is it the dimples that the golf balls have? But these have been around a long time...or is it the clubs, and the swing technique invented by more recent players? 

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

**Histograms** are best to show the distribution of values of a *quantitative variable*. A *distribution* shows *how often* the variable in question lies within specific value ranges. We plot the histogram by displaying the *how often* vs **defined ranges**, often called *buckets* or *bins*. For example, in 2017, 8.5% of all drive distances were at the then average distance of 292.1 yards. One can create histogram buckets from Quant variables, such as 0-5, 6-10, 11-15...etc.

::: callout-important
### Histograms vs Bar/Column Charts
As we will see shortly, **Bar/Column charts** show *categorical data*, such as the number of apples, bananas, carrots, etc. Visually speaking, histograms do not usually show spaces between buckets because these are *continuous values*, while column charts *must* show spaces to separate each *category*. More later.

### Using Orange

Let us rapidly make some histograms in Orange, so that we know how the tool works here. We start with the `iris` dataset: Download this *Orange workflow* file and open it in Orange.

{{< downloadthis Orange/iris_histogram.ows dname="iris_histogram" label="Download the Histogram Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

You can see the effect of modifying the bin widths, and of fitting a standard distribution for comparison.


### Using RAWgraphs


### Using DataWrapper

<https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/136-histogram-min-max-median-mean>

DataWrapper does not offer a separate histogram-making tool. Histograms in DataWrapper are available as a part of the data-inspection part of the work flow, as a small thumbnail-sized plot.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions

Let's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Histograms.

::: callout-note
Q1. What is the distribution of `IMDB_Rating`? If we split/colour by movie `Genere`?

::: {#fig-netflix-histograms layout-ncol=2}

Netflix Data Histograms

:::

:::

::: callout-note
Q2. Are `IMDB_Rating` affected by the number of `Seasons` or `Episodes`?

::: {#fig-IMDB-Rating-vs-Seasons-Episodes layout-ncol=2}

![Reformatting "Seasons"](images/ReformatVariable.png){#fig-ReformatVariable} 

![IMDB Rating vs Seasons](images/IMDBvsSeason.png){#fig-IMDBvsSeason}

Plotting with `Seasons`

:::

We first need to reformat the `Seasons` variable from **N** to **C** in the data file view. This converts it to Qual. Then we split the IMDB histogram by this new variable.

:::

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

Most movies have decent IMDB scores; the distribution is left-skewed. Some of course have been trashed!! Splitting `IMDBRating` by `Genere` is not too illuminating...

Not much wisdom to be gleaned either from splitting `IMDBRating` by `Seasons`...

## {{< iconify emojione books >}} Dataset: the Old Faithful geyser in the USA

Here is a dataset about the eruption durations, and wait times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, USA.

Download this data to your machine and import it into Orange.

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

-   Both durations have a "double-humped" distribution...
-   There are therefore two distinct ranges for both durations.
-   Are there two different mechanisms at work in the geyser, that randomly kick in?

## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn

Try your hand at these datasets. Look at the data table, state the data dictionary, contemplate a few Research Questions and answer them with graphs in Orange!

```{r echo=FALSE}
airbnb <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/1_OneNum.csv", header=TRUE)

apartments <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/2_TwoNum.csv", header=T, sep=",") %>% select(GrLivArea, SalePrice)

```

1.  Airbnb Price Data on the French Riviera\

```{r, echo = FALSE}

1. Wage and Education Data from Canada

1. Time taken to Open or Close Packages

Some HCD peasants tested Elderly people, some with and some without hand pain, and observed how long they took to open or close typical packages for milk, cheese, bottles etc. 

{{< downloadthis data/Usability_Test_Opening_Times.xlsx dname="Opening_Times" label="Download the Package Opening Times xlsx" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

::: callout-note
Orange can handle xlsx files directly. Try!
How might you disregard the different package types and concentrate on "Opening/Closing Times" vs "Hand Pain or no Hand Pain"?

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Histograms are used to study the distribution of one or a few variables.\
- Checking the distribution of your variables one by one is probably the first task you should do when you get a new dataset.\
- It delivers a good quantity of information about spread, how frequent the observations are, and if there are some outlandish ones.\
- Comparing histograms side-by-side helps to provide insight about whether a Quant measurement varies with situation (a Qual variable). We will see this properly in [a statistical way](../28-BoxPlotsViolins/index.qmd#are-the-differences-significant) soon.


Several distribution shapes exist, here is an illustration of the 6 most common ones:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Build dataset with different distributions

data <- data.frame(
  type = c( rep("edge peak", 1000), rep("comb", 1000), rep("normal", 1000), rep("uniform", 1000), rep("bimodal", 1000), rep("skewed", 1000) ),
  value = c( rnorm(900), rep(3, 100), rnorm(360, sd=0.5), rep(c(-1,-0.75,-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0.75), 80), rnorm(1000), runif(1000), rnorm(500, mean=-2), rnorm(500, mean=2), abs(log(rnorm(1000))) )
)

# Represent it
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=value)) +
    geom_histogram(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    facet_wrap(~type, scale="free_x") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      axis.title.x=element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
    )
```

What insights could you develop based on these distribution shapes?\
- *Bimodal*: Maybe two different systems or phenomena or regimes under which the data unfolds. Like our geyser above. Or a machine that works differently when cold and when hot. Intermittent faulty behaviour...\
- *Comb*: Some specific Observations occur predominantly, in an otherwise even spread or observations. In a survey many respondents round off numbers to nearest 100 or 1000. Check the distribution of this [diamonds dataset for carat values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/main/data-raw/diamonds.csv) which are suspiciously integer numbers in too many cases.\
- *Edge Peak*: Could even be a data entry artifact!! All unknown / unrecorded observations are recorded as $999$ !!`r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")`\
- *Normal*: Just what it says! Marks in a Univ cohort..\
- *Skewed*: Income, or friends count in a set of people. Do UI/UX peasants have more followers than say CAP people?\
- *Uniform*: The World is flat. Anything can happen within a range. But not much happens outside! Sharp limits...

In your Design-Project-related research, you will collect data from or about your target audience. The Quantitative parts of that data may obtain with any of these distributions. Inspecting these may give you an insight into the **population** of your target audience, something that may likely be true, a hunch, which you could verify and convert into ...opportunity.
