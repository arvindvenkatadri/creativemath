## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

In many design project situations, we perform say *target audience surveys* to get
[Likert Scale](https://www.simplypsychology.org/likert-scale.html) data,
where several respondents rate a product or a service on a scale of
`Very much like`, `somewhat like`, `neutral`, `Dislike` and
`Very much dislike,` for example.

## Variable Labels and Value Labels

**Variable label** is human readable description of the variable. R
supports rather long variable names and these names can contain even
spaces and punctuation but short variables names make coding easier.
Variable label can give a nice, long description of variable. With this
description it is easier to remember what those variable names refer
to.\
**Value labels** are similar to variable labels, but value labels are
descriptions of the values a variable can take. Labeling values means we
don't have to remember if `1=Extremely poor` and `7=Excellent` or
vice-versa. We can easily get dataset description and variables summary
with info function.

### Using Orange

The description of the Orange widget for mosaic charts is [here.](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/mosaicdisplay)

Let us take a very sadly famous data set (no, not `iris` again `r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")`), but `titanic` and examine it in Orange.

{{< downloadthis orange/orange-mosaic-chart.ows dname="mosaic-chart" label="Download the Orange Mosaic Chart Workflow" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}


### Using RAWgraphs

Not a mosaic plot, but a [Matrix Plot](https://www.rawgraphs.io/learning/how-to-make-a-matrix-plot). 

{{< video https://youtu.be/VEERjBnsS1w >}}


Download this RAWGraphs workflow file and import there and see.

## {{< iconify game-icons iceberg size=3x >}} Dataset: CareGivers


Here is another example of Likert data from the *healthcare industry*.

`efc` is a German data set from a European study titled [**EUROFAM
study**](https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/48.6.752), on *family care of
older people*. Following a common protocol, data were collected from
national samples of approximately 1,000 family carers (i.e. caregivers)
per country and clustered into comparable subgroups to facilitate
cross-national analysis. The *research questions* in [**this EUROFAM
study**](https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/48.6.752) were:

> 1.  To what extent do family carers of older people use support
>     services or receive financial allowances across Europe? What kind
>     of supports and allowances do they mainly use?
>
> 2.  What are the main difficulties carers experience accessing the
>     services used? What prevents carers from accessing unused supports
>     that they need? What causes them to stop using still-needed
>     services?
>
> 3.  In order to improve support provision, what can be understood
>     about the service characteristics considered crucial by carers,
>     and how far are these needs met? and,
>
> 4.  Which channels or actors can provide the greatest help in
>     underpinning future policy efforts to improve access to
>     services/supports?

We will select the variables from the `efc` data set that related to
*coping* (on part of care-givers) and plot their responses after
inspecting them:

```{r}
#| label: efc_data
#| layout-nrow: 2
#| column: body-outset-right
#| echo: fenced
data(efc,package = "sjPlot")

efc %>% 
  select(dplyr::contains("cop")) %>% 
  head(20)
efc %>% 
  select(dplyr::contains("cop")) %>% 
  str()

```

The `cop`ing related variables have responses on the Likert Scale
`(1,2,3,4)` which correspond to `(never, sometimes, often, always)`,
**and** each variable also has a `label` defining each variable. The
labels are actually ( and perhaps usually ) the *questions* in the
survey.

-   `status`: (chr) Class of Travel, else "crew"
-   `age`: (chr) Adult, Child
-   `sex`: (chr) Male / Female.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions
::: callout-note
### Q.1. What is the dependence of `survived` upon `sex`?

![Titanic Mosaic Chart](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-sex-survived.png){#fig-titanic-mosaic}

Note the huge imbalance in `survived` with `sex`: men have clearly perished in larger numbers than women. Which is why the colouring by the Pearson Residuals show large [*positive* residuals]{style="color: blue;"} for men who died, and large [*negative* residuals]{style="color: red;"} for women who died 
:::

::: callout-note
### Q.2. How does `survived` depend upon `status`?

![Titanic Mosaic Chart](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-mosaic-survived-status.png){#fig-titanic-mosaic}

Crew has seen deaths in large numbers, as seen by the large [*negative* residual]{style="color: red;"} for crew-survivals. 
First Class passengers have had speedy access to the boats and have survived in larger proportions than say second or third class. There is a large [*positive* residual]{style="color: blue;"} for first-class survivals. 

:::

### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?

In @fig-titanic-mosaic, we have plotted `sex` vs `status`, and coloured by whether the (subset of) people survived or not. (Red is YES, Blue is NO!). As can be seen the areas are very dissimilar across both variables. More deaths occurred among the crew than among the passengers; and first class passengers have survived more than third class passengers. And of course, more men died than women. 

So we can state that:

- `Status` and `Survived` are not un-correlated
- `Sex` and `Survived` are not un-correlated
- Does ticking the `Compare with Total` box in Orange help to arrive at this inference? How so?

It remains to figure out just how serious this correlation is.

## Actual and "Expected" Counts

The mosaic chart is a visualization of the *obtained count* on which the tile is constructed. 

It is also possible to compute a per-cell *expected count*, if the categorical variables are **assumed independent**, that is, not correlated. This is the NULL Hypothesis. The test for whether they are independent or not, as any inferential test, is based on comparing the *observed counts* with these *expected counts* under the null hypothesis. So, what might the expected frequency of a cell be in cross-tabulation table for cell $i,j$ given no relationship between the variables of interest?

Represent the sum of row $i$ with $n_{+i}$, the sum of column $j$ with
$n_{j+}$, and the grand total of all the observations with $n$. And [independence of variables means that their joint probability is the product of their probabilities](https://brilliant.org/wiki/probability-rule-of-product/). Therefore, the Expected Cell Frequency/Count is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{lcl} ~Expected~Count~ e_{i,j}  &=& \frac{rowSum ~\times~colSum}{n}\\
&=& \frac{(n_{+i})(n_{j+})}{n}\\
\end{array}
$$

The comparison of what occurred to what is expected is based on their
difference, scaled by the square root of the expected, the **Pearson Residual**:

$$
\begin{array}{lcl} r_{i,j} &=& \frac{(Actual - Expected)}{\sqrt{\displaystyle Expected}}\\
&=& \frac{(o_{i,j}- e_{i,j})}{\sqrt{\displaystyle e_{i,j}}}
\end{array}
$$

The sum of all the squared Pearson residuals is the chi-square statistic, χ2, upon which the inferential analysis follows.

Let us take this dataset on household tasks, and who does them. Download this dataset and import in into your Mosaic Chart workflow.

![Household Tasks Distribution Raw Data](../../../../materials/images/Orange/household-mosaic-initial.png){#fig-household-tasks-mosaic}
:::

This data looks fine all right, but the mosaic plot looks bewildering and of course is wrong. The reason for this is that the basic `HouseTasks.csv` data is **pre-aggregated**: we have a neat column of counts *already* in the `Freq` data. And why is this a problem? Orange expects data to be *purely categorical* and does it own counting, and is not able to sensibly use this `Freq` column. Orange simply counts categories, which are of course utterly symmetric and unique. 

::: callout-note
## Stat Figures and Stats
Most, if not all,  statistical graphs do some **internal computation**. For instance the bar chart performs counts vs Qual variables; a Histogram both bins the Quant variable, and counts for entries in each bin. This is a good thing, people, but it does mean that the data needs to be in specific format before using it for plots. 
:::

So now what? We need to (wait for it):

- `uncount` the data `r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")`
- Take each combination of Quals `Who` and `Task`
- Repeat ( i.e copy-paste) that combo line as many times as the value in `Freq`
- (optionally) Deleting the `Freq` column, or at least not using it further

All this is (to the best of my ability) **not possible** in any of [these trifling tools](https://storymirror.com/read/gujarati/poem/uuntt-khe/sf6dazbo) that we are using here, and can be done in a jiffy in R or Python. Didn't I tell you coding was far far far far simpler? Peasants. 

So following this [ashtavakra](https://isha.sadhguru.org/en/wisdom/audio/the-story-of-ashtavakra-and-janaka) procedure, good things can be made to happen, and here is the "un-aggregated" data for you:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
household_tasks <- read_csv("data/HouseTasks.csv")
household_tasks %>% tidyr::uncount(weights = Freq, .remove = FALSE) %>% download_this(output_name = "household_tasks_uncounted", output_extension = ".csv", button_label = "Household data Cleaned up for Peasants", button_type = "default", icon = "fa fa-save")

```
Import this into Orange.
