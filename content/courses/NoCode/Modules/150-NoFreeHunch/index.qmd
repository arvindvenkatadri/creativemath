## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #1: I am an INTJ

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Srishti kids are predominantly introverted
:::

What are we looking at, data-wise? A *proportion*, which if more than 50% would justify our hunch. So we do an MBTI on some unsuspecting **sample** of people, and try to generalize that result to the **population**


## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #2: Let's Go to ChefsTouch(?)

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Most people think the food in the cafeteria is ordinary.
:::
Again, a survey of a sample. Opinions, yes or no. A Proportion for the sample, and an extension to the population. A *proportion test*.

## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #3: I will eat my tip, thank you. 

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} The average tip people give is higher for people who are non-vegetarians. Regardless of whether you are [going Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch) or not.
:::

Are vegetarians more kanjoos? Or it is the meat-eaters?

So Swiggy/Zomato/Dining Out bills. For both sets of people. And then the t-t-t-t-t-test...


## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #3. Art, Design, and Vocation are all diff-different. 

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Grades are very different between B.Voc, B.Cra, and B.Des folks. 
:::

So? Grades of course, for a good sample from all *three* groups of people..and then?
ANOVA of course.
