## Introduction

Let's make a website in RStudio to show off our data viz portfolio, and
to share with friends, parents, prospective employers...

We will encounter a new package called `blogdown` and use workflows with
[github](https://github.com) and a free web hosting service called
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.app) to create a website where all our
RMarkdowns become individual blog posts, complete with Titles, Sections,
Text, Diagrams and Links!

NOTE: Need to update this to Quarto!!!
