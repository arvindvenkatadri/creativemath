## Installing Radiant

You can download and install Radiant from here:

<https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/install.html>

::: callout-important
NOTE: This automatically installs R, RStudio, and Radiant on your
machine. This is going to be convenient when we start working in R too!

It also installs Latex, which allows us to create crisp PDF reports of
our analyses.

The version of R may not be the latest one, though...
