## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration

![Box Plot Inspiration](what-we-mean-when-we-say.jpeg){#fig-boxplot-inspiration}

[Alice said, "I say what I mean and I mean what I say!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1abf1dg/comment/kjn85an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Are the rest of us so sure? What do we mean when we use any of the phrases above? How definite are we? There is a range of "sureness" and "unsureness"...and this is where we can use box plots like @fig-boxplot-inspiration to show that range of opinion.


## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?

Box Plots are an extremely useful data visualization that gives us an idea of the distribution of a Quant variable, for each *level* of another Qual variable. The internal process of this plot is as follows:

  - make groups of the Quant variable for each level of the Qual
  - in each group, rank the Quant variable values in increasing order
  - Calculate: `median`, `IQR`, `outliers`
  - plot these as a vertical or horizontal box structure

The box  can also be asymmetric "half plots" if needed...

::: callout-note
### Histograms and Box Plots
Note how the histogram that dwells upon the `mean` and `standard deviation`, whereas the boxplot focuses on the `median` and `quartiles`.
The former uses the *values* of the Quant variable, whereas the latter uses their *sequence number* or *ranks*. 
:::

Box plots are often used for example in HR operations to understand Salary distributions across grades of employees. Marks of students in competitive exams are also declared using Quartiles. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot-diagram
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Box Plot Definitions"
set.seed(123)
MKdescr::illustrate.boxplot(rt(150, df = 10))

```

Box plots can show skew in distributions. In such cases the "bottom" and the "lid" of the box may not be the same size!

![Density and Skewness](../../../../../materials/images/Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png){#fig-distribution-skewness}

Box Plot Discussions

:::

In the @fig-three-boxplots, we see the difference between boxplots that show *symmetric* and *skewed* distributions. The "lid" and the "bottom" of the box are not of similar width in distributions with significant skewness. 

Compare these with the corresponding @fig-distribution-skewness.

## {{< iconify grommet-icons test >}} Case Study-1: `gss_wages` dataset

We will first look at Wage data from the General Social Survey (1974-2018) conducted in the USA, which is used to illustrate wage discrepancies by gender (while also considering respondent occupation, age, and education). This is available on [Vincent Arel-Bundock's superb repository of datasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html). Let us read into R *directly from the website*. 

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke; border: 1px solid"}

#| label: read_gss_wage_data
#| message: false
wages <- read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/stevedata/gss_wages.csv")

```

The data has automatically been read into the `webr` session, so you can continue on to the next code chunk!

### Data Dictionary for the `wages` dataset
From the [dataset documentation page](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/stevedata/gss_wages.html), we note that:

-   This is a large dataset (61K rows), with 11 variables:\
  - `year`(dbl): the survey year\
  - `realrinc`(dbl): the respondent's base income (in constant 1986 USD\
  - `age`(dbl): the respondent's age in years\
  - `occ10`(dbl): respondent's occupation code (2010)\
  - `occrecode`(chr): recode of the occupation code into one of 11 main categories\
  - `prestg10`(dbl): respondent's occupational prestige score (2010)\
  - `childs`(dbl): number of children (0-8)\
  - `wrkstat`(chr): the work status of the respondent (full-time, part-time, temporarily not working, unemployed (laid off), retired, school, housekeeper, other). 8 levels.\ 
  - `gender`(chr): respondent's gender (male or female). 2 levels.\
  - `educcat`(chr): respondent's degree level (Less Than High School, High School, Junior College, Bachelor, or Graduate). 5 levels.\
  - `maritalcat`(chr): respondent's marital status (Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, Never Married). 5 levels.\
:::

::: callout-note
### Business Insights based on `wages` dataset
- Fair amount of missing data; however with 61K rows, we can for the present simply neglect the missing data. 
- Good mix of Qual and Quant variables
:::

::: callout-note
### Hypothesis and Research Questions
- The target variable for an experiment that resulted in this data might be the `realinc` variable, the resultant income of the individual. Which is numerical variable. 
- Research Questions:
  - What is the basic distribution of `realrinc`?
  - Is `realrinc` affected by `gender`? 
  - By `educcat`? By `maritalcat`?
  - Is `realrinc` affected by `child`? 
  - Do combinations of these factors have an effect on the target variable?
  
These should do for now! But we should make more questions when have seen some plots!

:::

### {{< iconify carbon clean >}} Data Munging
 Since there are so many missing data in the target variable `realinc` *and* there is still enough data leftover, let us remove the rows containing missing data in that variable. 
 
::: callout-important
NOTE: This is not advised at all as a general procedure!! Data is valuable and there are better ways to manage this problem!
:::

```{r}
#| label: data-cleanup

wages_clean <- 
  wages %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na(realrinc) # choose column or leave blank to choose all

```


```{webr-r}

wages_clean <- 
  wages %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na(realinc)

```

:::

### Business Insights-2
- Even when split by `gender`, `realincome` presents a skewed set of distributions.
- The IQR for `male`s is smaller than the IQR for `female`s. There is less variation in the middle ranges of `realrinc` for men. 
- log10 transformation helps to view and understand the regions of low `realrinc`. 
- There are outliers on both sides, indicating that there may be many people who make very small amounts of money and large amounts of money in both `gender`s.

### Business Insights-3

- `realrinc` rises with `educcat`, which is to be expected.
- However, there are people with *very low* and *very high* income in all categories of `educcat`
- Hence `educcat` *alone* may not be a good predictor for `realrinc`. 
:::

We can do similar work with the other Qual variables. Let us now see how we can use more than one Qual variable and answer the last hypothesis, Question 4.

### {{< iconify el question-sign >}} Question-4: Is the target variable `realrinc` affected by combinations of Qual factors `gender`, `educcat`, `maritalcat` and `childs`?
::: callout-important 
This is a rather complex question and could take us deep into [Modelling](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html). Ideally we ought to:\
- take each Qual variable, explain its effect on the target variable\
- **remove that effect** and model the remainder ( i.e. *residual*) with the next Qual variable\
- Proceed in this way until we have a good model.\
if we are going to do this manually. There are more modern [Modelling Workflows](workflows), that can do things much faster and without such manual tweaking. 
:::

So will simply plot box plots showing effects on the target variable of *combinations* of Qual variables taken two at a time. (We will of course use facetted box plots!)

We will also drop NA values all around this time, to avoid seeing boxplots for undocumented categories.

### Business Insights-4
- From @fig-income-by-educcat-childs-ggformula-1, we see that `realrinc` increases with `educcat`, across (almost) all family sizes `childs`. 
- However, this trend breaks a little when family sizes `childs` is large, say >= 7. Be aware that the data observations for such large families may be sparse and this inference may not be necessarily valid.
- From @fig-income-by-educcat-childs-ggformula-2, we see that the effect of `childs` on `realrinc` is different for each `gender`! For *females*, the income steadily drops with the number of children, whereas for *males* it actually increases up to a certain family size before decreasing again.

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

-   Box Plots "dwell upon" **medians** and **Quartiles**
-   Box Plots can show distributions of a Quant variable over levels of a Qual variable
- This allows a comparison of box plots side by side to visibly detect differences in median and IQR across such levels
