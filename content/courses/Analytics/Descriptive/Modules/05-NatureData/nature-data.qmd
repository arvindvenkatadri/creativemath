## {{< iconify mdi web-check >}} Using web-R
This tutorial uses `web-r` that allows you to run all code within your browser, on all devices. Most code chunks herein are formatted in a tabbed structure ( like in an old-fashioned library) with duplicated code. The tabs in front have regular R code that will work when copy-pasted in your RStudio session. The tab "behind" has the `web-R` code that can work directly in your browser, and can be modified as well. The R code is also there to make sure you have original code to go back to, when you have made several modifications to the code on the `web-r` tabs and need to compare your code with the original!


#### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Run selected code using either:
  - macOS: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>↩/Return</kbd>
  - Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↩/Enter</kbd>
- Run the entire code by clicking the "Run code" button or pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↩</kbd>.

## {{< fa envelope title="An envelope" >}} Where does Data come from? {#sec-where-data}

We will need to form a basic understanding of basic scientific
enterprise. Let us look at the
[**slides**](https://r-for-artists.netlify.app/slides/10-nature-of-data/10-nature-of-data).
(Also embedded below!)

```{r}
#| echo: false

#| out-height: 640px

```

## {{< fa chart-simple >}} Why Visualize?

-   We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial
-   Our [Working
    Memories](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/working-memory-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)
    are both *short-term* and *limited* in capacity. So a picture
    abstracts the details and presents us with [an overall
    summary]{style="background-color: yellow;"}, an insight, or a story
    that is both easy to recall and easy on retention.
-   Data Viz includes [*shapes* that carry strong cultural
    memories]{style="background-color: yellow;"}; and impressions for
    us. These cultural memories help us to use data viz in a *universal
    way* to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. [(Do humans have a
    gene for
    geometry?]{style="background-color: yellow;"}[^1][)]{style="background-color: yellow;"};
-   It helps sift facts and mere statements: for example:

## Tidy Data

Each **variable** is a column; a column contains *one kind* of data.
Each **observation** or **case** is a row.
:::

## {{< fa glasses >}} How do we Spot Data Variable Types? {#sec-data-types}

[By asking questions!]{style="background-color: yellow;"} Shown below is
a table of different kinds of questions you could use to query a
dataset. The variable or variables that "answer" the question would be
in the category indicated by the question.

::: column-page
```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
pronouns <- read_csv("pronouns.csv")
pronouns %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)
```
:::

As you go from [Qualitative to Quantitative data
types](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-hello.html#variable-types)
in the table, I hope you can detect a movement from fuzzy
groups/categories to more and more crystallized numbers.

![Type of
Variables](/content/materials/images/Ratio-Interval-Ordinal-Nominal.PNG){fig-align="center"}

Each variable/scale can be subjected to the operations of the previous
group. In the words of [S.S.
Stevens](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/)

> the basic operations needed to create each type of scale is
> cumulative: to an operation listed opposite a particular scale must be
> added all those operations preceding it.

## Some Examples of Data Variables


### Example 1: `AllCountries`
::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
#### Base R
```{r}
#| echo: false

head(AllCountries,5) %>% arrange(desc(Internet))
```

#### {{< iconify noto-v1 spider-web >}} web-r
```{webr-r}
head(AllCountries,5) %>% arrange(desc(Internet))
```

:::


::: callout-note
#### Questions

Q1. How many people in Andorra have internet access?\
A1. This leads to the `Internet` variable, which is a Quantitative
variable, a proportion.[^2] The answer is $70.5\%$.
:::

### Example 2:`StudentSurveys`

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
#### Base R
```{r}
#| echo: false

head(StudentSurvey,5)

```

#### {{< iconify noto-v1 spider-web >}} web-r
```{webr-r}
#| echo: false
#| column: body-outset-right
head(StudentSurvey,5)

```

## Questions

Q.1. *What kind* of students are these?\
A.1. The *variables* `Gender`, and `Year` both answer to this Question.
And they are both Qualitative/Categorical variables, of course.\
Q.2. *What is* their status in their respective families?\
A.2. Hmm...they are either first-born, or second-born, or third...etc.
While this is **recorded** as a number, it is **still a Qualitative**
variable[^3]! Think! Can you do math operations with `BirthOrder`? Like
`mean` or `median`?\
Q.3.**How big** are the families?\
A.3. Clearly, the variable that answers is `Siblings` and since the
question is synonymous with "how many", this is a Quantitative
variable.\

## {{< iconify material-symbols auto-graph >}} What is a Data Visualization?

### {{< iconify carbon chart-network >}} Data Viz = Data + Geometry

#### {{< iconify fa6-solid shapes >}} Shapes

[Data Visualization is the act of "mapping" a geometric aspect/aesthetic
to a variable in data.]{style="background: yellow;"}The aesthetic then
varies in accordance with the data variable, creating (part of) a chart.

What might be the geometric aesthetics available to us? An
[aesthetic]{style="background: yellow;"} is a geometric property, such
as `x-coordinate`, `y-coordinate`,
`length/breadth/height`,`radius`,`shape`,`size`, `linewidth`,
`linetype`, and even `colour`...

![Common Geometric Aesthetics in
Charts](/content/materials/images/common-aesthetics-1.png){fig-align="center"}

#### {{< iconify material-symbols function >}} Mapping

What does this "mapping" mean? That the geometric aesthetics are used to
*represent* qualitative or quantitative variables from your data, [by
varying in accordance to the data
variable]{style="background: yellow;"}. For instance, `length` or
`height` of a `bar` can be made proportional to the`age` or `income` of
a person. `Colour` of points can be mapped to `gender`, with a unique
`colour` for each `gender`. `Position` along an axis x can vary in
accordance with a `height` variable and y with a `bodyWeight` variable.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

g <- diamonds %>% slice_sample(n = 150,weight_by = cut) %>% 
  gf_point(price ~ carat, colour = ~ cut, shape = ~ cut, 
           size = 4, data = .) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Plot Title", 
       subtitle = "Plot Subtitle",
       caption = "Plot Caption",
       x = "x-Axis Title",
       y = "y-Axis Title") %>% 
  gf_text(17000 ~ 1.0, label = "Annotation", color = "orange", 
          size = 7, fontface = "bold", show.legend = FALSE) %>% 
  
  # Use same name for scales to merge legends
  gf_refine(scale_color_brewer(name = "Plot Legend", palette = "Set1"),
            scale_shape_manual(name = "Plot Legend", values = c(15:21))) %>% 
  
  gf_theme(theme_bw()) %>%  
  gf_theme(
        plot.title.position = "panel", # try "plot"
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20,colour = "orange"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12,colour = "orange"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, colour = "orange"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, colour = "orange"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, colour = "orange"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, colour = "orange")
        )
g

```

A chart may use more than one aesthetic: `position`, `shape`, `colour`,
`height` and `angle`,`pattern` or `texture` to name several. Usually,
each aesthetic is mapped to **just one** variable to ensure there is no
cognitive error. There is of course a choice and you should be able to
**map** any kind of variable to any geometric aspect/aesthetic that may
be available.

::: callout-note
### A Natural Mapping

Note that here is also a "natural" mapping between aesthetic and
\[**kind of variable**\] @sec-data-types, Quantitative or Qualitative.
For instance, `shape` is rarely mapped to a Quantitative variable; we
understand this because the nature of variation between the Quantitative
variable and the `shape` aesthetic is not similar (i.e. not continuous).
Bad choices may lead to bad, or worse, misleading charts!
:::

In the above chart, it is pretty clear what kind of variable is plotted
on the `x-axis` and the `y-axis`. What about `colour`? Could this be
considered a `z-axis` in the chart? There are also other aspects that
you can choose (not explicitly shown here) such as the
`plot theme`(colours, fonts, backgrounds etc), which may **not be
mapped** to data, but are nonetheless choices to be made. We will get
acquainted with this aspect as we build charts.

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Basic Types of Charts {#sec-data-viz}

We can think of simple visualizations as [combinations of aesthetics,
mapped to combinations of variables]{style="background: yellow;"}. Some
examples:

: Geometries , Combinations, and Graphs


## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

So there we have it:

-   Questions lead to Types of Variables (Quant and Qual)\
-   Further Questions lead to *relationships* between them, which we
    describe using Data Visualizations\
-   Data Visualizations are Data mapped onto Geometry 
-   Multiple Variable-to-Geometry Mappings = A Complete Data
    Visualization\

You might think of all these Questions, Answers, Mapping as being
equivalent to **metaphors** as a language in itself. And indeed, in R we
use a philosophy called the **Grammar of Graphics**! We will use this
grammar in the R graphics packages that we will encounter.
