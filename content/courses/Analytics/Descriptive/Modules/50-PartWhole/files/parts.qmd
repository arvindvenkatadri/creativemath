# Introduction

We will create Data Visualizations in R to show Parts ofa Whole. As
always, we will consistently use the [**Project
Mosaic**](https://mosaic-web.org) ecosystem of packages in R (`mosaic`,
`mosaicData` and `ggformula`). Some specialized plots ( e.g. Fan Plots)
may require us to load other R Packages. These will be introduced
appropriately.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T, comment = "#>", echo = TRUE)
options(tibble.print_min = 4L, tibble.print_max = 4L)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic) # package for stats, simulations, and basic plots
library(mosaicData) # package containing datasets
library(ggformula) # package for professional looking plots, that use the formula interface from mosaic
library(NHANES) # survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
library(plotrix)

```

Recall the standard method for all commands from the `mosaic` package:

goal( y \~ x \| z, data = mydata, ...)
