## {{< iconify entypo line-graph >}} What Time Evolution Charts can we plot?

In these cases, the x-axis is typically *time*...and we chart the
variable of another Quant variable with respect to time, using a *line*
geometry.

Let is take a healthcare budget dataset from [Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID):
We will plot graphs for 5 countries (India, China, Brazil, Russia,
Canada ). Download this data by clicking on the button below:

{{< downloadthis data/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID.csv dname="public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID" label="Download the Health data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

```{r}
health <-
  read_csv("data/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID.csv")

health_filtered <- health %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c(
    "India",
    "China",
    "United States",
    "United Kingdom",
    "Russia",
    "Sweden"
  ))

```

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
gf_point(data = health_filtered,
             public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp ~ Year, 
             colour = ~ Entity, 
             ylab = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP",
         title = "Line Charts to show Evolution (over Time )") %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

gf_area(data = health_filtered,
          public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp ~ Year, 
          fill = ~ Entity, alpha = 0.3, 
          ylab = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP",
        title = "Area Charts to show Evolution (over Time )") %>% 
  gf_line(colour = ~ Entity) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```

## {{< iconify carbon sankey-diagram-alt >}} What Space Evolution Charts can we plot?

Here, the *space* can be any Qual variable, and we can chart another
Quant or Qual variable move across levels of the first chosen Qual
variable.

For instance we can contemplate Enrollment at a University, and show how
students move from course to course in a University. Or how customers
drift from one category of products or brands to another....or the
movement of cricket players from one IPL Team to another !!

> A `Sankey diagram` is a visualization used to depict a flow from one

> **`stages/axes`**`, nodes / strata / lodes,` and the connections are

> courses during a semester of study.

## Switching to ggplot here

For the next few charts, there are (as yet) no equivalents in
`ggformula`. Hence we will use `ggplot`.
:::

```{r}
#| label: more-charts
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

# library(ggalluvial)
data("Titanic")
Titanic <- Titanic %>% as_tibble()
Titanic

```

::: callout-note
## Table Form Data

Note that this data is in **tidy** and **table** form, with separate
columns for each Qualitative variable and a separate `count` column,
which we saw when we examined Categorical Data. This is intuitively the
best form of data to plot a Sankey plot with. But there are other forms,
which you will find examples of on the ggalluvial website.
<https://corybrunson.github.io/ggalluvial/>
:::

```{r}
Titanic %>% ggplot(data = .,
    
# Select the Categorical Variables for the vertical Axes / Stages
       aes(axis1 = Class, 
           axis2 = Sex, 
           axis3 = Age,
           y = n), fill = "white") +
  
# Alluvials between Categorical Axes
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Survived), 
                colour = "black", 
                linewidth = 0.25) +
  
# Vertical segments for each Categorical Variable2 
  geom_stratum(colour = "black", 
               linewidth = 1, 
               fill = "white") + 
  
# Labels for each "level" of the Categorical Axes
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", 
            aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  

  
# Scales and Colours
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Class", "Sex", "Age"), 
                   expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkgoldenrod", "purple")) + 
  
  xlab("Demographic") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("passengers on the maiden voyage of the Titanic",
          "stratified by demographics and survival")

```

> Here is how the package `ggalluvial` defines the elements of a typical
> alluvial plot:
>
> -   An **axis** is a dimension (variable) along which the data are
>     vertically arranged at a fixed horizontal position. The plot above
>     uses three categorical axes: Class, Sex, and Age.
> -   The groups at each axis are depicted as opaque blocks called
>     **strata**. For example, the Class axis contains four strata: 1st,
>     2nd, 3rd, and Crew.
> -   Horizontal (x-) splines called **alluvia** span the width of the
>     plot. In this plot, each alluvium corresponds to a fixed value of
>     each axis variable, indicated by its vertical position at the
>     axis, as well as of the Survived variable, indicated by its fill
>     color.
> -   The segments of the alluvia between pairs of adjacent axes are
>     **flows**.
> -   The alluvia intersect the strata at **lodes**. The lodes are not
>     visualized in the above plot, but they can be inferred as filled
>     rectangles extending the flows through the strata at each end of
>     the plot or connecting the flows on either side of the center
>     stratum.

Here is another example of a Sankey Diagram: This diagram show how
energy is converted or transmitted before being consumed or lost:
supplies are on the left, and demands are on the right. (Data:
Department of Energy & Climate Change via Tom Counsell):

This can be created using the package `ggforce`, which we might explore
later.

## {{< iconify icon-park-outline chart-histogram >}} Chord Diagram

![](images/chord.png){fig-align="center"}

We will explore this diagram when we explore network graphs with the
`tidygraph` and `ggraph` packages.

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

We see that we can visualize "evolutions" over time and space. The
evolutions can represent changes in the **quantities** of things, or
their **categorical** affiliations or groups.

What business data would you depict in this way? Revenue streams?
Employment? Expenditures over time and market? There are many
possibilities!

## Your Turn

1.  Within the `ggalluvial` package are two datasets, `majors` and
    `vaccinations`. Plot alluvial charts for both of these.
2.  Go to the [American Life Panel
    Website](https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data) where you
    will find many public datasets. Try to take one and make charts from
    it that we have learned in this Module.
