## What is Inference?

::: callout-important
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about the
entire population based on the information in a sample.
:::

In this Section we will examine samples from populations and find
procedures for estimating parameters such as `means` and `sd`. We will
also devise procedures for comparing `means` and `variances` across more
than one population. The conditions that make these procedures possible
and accurate will also be studied and we will find alternative methods
when those assumptions breakdown.

Based on our ideas of data and types of variables, here is a table of
what we may infer, based on the underlying data:

| Variable(s)           | Estimating:               | Population Parameter | Sample Statistic        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Single Qual variable  | Proportion                | p                    | $\hat{p}$               |
| Single Quant variable | Mean                      | $\mu$                | $\bar{x}$               |
| Two Qual Variables    | Difference in Proportions | $p_1 -p_2$           | $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$ |
| One Qual, one Quant   | Difference in Means       | $\mu_1 - \mu_2$      | $\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}$   |
| Two Quant variables   | Correlation               | $\rho$               | r                       |

: Data Types and Inference

We will examine inference procedures for all these cases.
