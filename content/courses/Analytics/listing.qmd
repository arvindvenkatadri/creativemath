## Abstract

This Course takes Business Practitioners and Design Peasants on a journey of Data
Analytics: using data to derive insights, make predictions, and decide
on plans of action that can be communicated and actualized in a Design and Business
context.

["Business analytics, or simply analytics, is the use of data,
 information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods,
 and mathematical or computer-based models to help managers gain
 improved insight about their business operations and make better,
 fact-based decisions. Business analytics is "a process of transforming
 data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of
 organizational decision making and problem solving"]{.f5 .f4-m .f3-l .lh-copy .measure .mt0}

<br> The Course starts with **Descriptive Analytics**: Datasets from various domains of business, design, and scientific activity are introduced. The datasets are motivated from the point of view of the types of information they contain: students will relate the Data Variables (Qualitative and Quantitative) to various types of Data/Information Visualizations.

**Statistical Concepts** such as ***Sampling, Hypothesis Tests, Simulation / Modelling, and Uncertainty*** will be introduced.

[**Predictive Analytics** will take us into looking at Data and training standard ML algorithms to make predictions with new Data. ***Regression, Clustering, and Classification*** will be covered.]{.bg-moon-gray}

[**Prescriptive Analytics** will deal with coming to terms with the uncertainty in Predictions, and using tools such as both ***ML, Linear/non-Linear Programming, and Decision-Making*** to make Business Decisions, with an assessment of the Risks involved.]{.bg-moon-gray}

The Course will include in a full **Data Analytics Workflow** that includes Data Gathering and Cleaning, Descriptive [and Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics]{.bg-moon-gray} and Decision Making, and Communication resulting in a publication-worthy documents.(HTML / PDF/ Word)

## What you will learn

-   **Data Basics**: What does data look like and why should we care?
- Understand the R language, and appreciate how close it is t plain English, for the most part
-   Rapidly and intuitively creating **Graphs and Data Visualizations** using geometric metaphors to explore data for insights
-   Use **Statistical Tests, Procedures, Models, and Simulations** and to answer Business and Design Questions
-   [Using **ML algorithms** such Regression, Classification, and
    Clustering to develop Business Insights]{.bg-moon-gray}
-   [Use **Linear Programming** to make Business Decisions]{.bg-moon-gray}
-   Create crisp and readable **Reports** that can be shared in a
    Business Context

## Pedagogical Notes

Why this course is what it is, and why it does what it does! [Only if you are planning to be an educator yourself!!]{.bg-light-green}

#### PRIMM
The method followed will be based on [PRIMM](https://primmportal.com):

- PREDICT: Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do, write predictions
- RUN: the code provided and check what happens
- INFER: what the parameters of the code do and write comments to explain. What bells and whistles can you see?
- MODIFY: the parameters code provided to understand the options available. Write comments to show what you have aimed for and achieved.
- MAKE: take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

![From https://primmportal.com, used *without permission*](https://primmportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/primm-diagram.png?w=784)

So in this course, wherever you see "YOUR TURN", please respond with questions of the data, explanations, more questions and [if you are already confident](https://youtu.be/JJYz8pyXOG4), code chunks to create new calculations and graphs.


#### And why teach R in this way?

Because we all know two things:

- Pretty decent English
- [$y = mx + c$](https://youtu.be/ZK1PBh-yMZE)

Let us hear from Amelia McNamara:

## Our Tools

This is eventually meant to be a ~~three~~ many-in-one course, based on the following free and open source tools:

1.  **R** <https://cran.r-project.org/> and **RStudio**
    <https://posit.co/>

    R is a freely available language and environment for statistical
    computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical
    and graphical techniques: *linear and nonlinear modelling,
    statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering*,etc. RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python**.

2.  **Orange Data Mining** <https://orangedatamining.com/>

    Orange is also a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) visual point-and-click software for Data Mining and ML, developed at the University of Slovenia, in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

{{< youtube HXjnDIgGDuI >}}

<br>

2.  **Radiant -- Business analytics using R and Shiny**
    <https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/index.html>

    Radiant is a FOSS platform-independent browser-based interface for business analytics in R, developed at the University of San Diego. The application is based on the Shiny package and can be run using R, or in your browser with no installation required. The tool automatically installs a version of R and adds a Shiny-based GUI that removes the need to write R-code. Radiant can also be installed on top of an existing installation of R and invoked from within RStudio.
