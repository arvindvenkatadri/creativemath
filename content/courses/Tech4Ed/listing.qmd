## Introduction

This is my exploration of diverse tools to help explain things better. I will look at :

1. Idyll Language: <u><https://idyll-lang.org></u>
2. Observable JavaScript: <https://observablehq.com/>
3. Kinetic Graphs: <https://kineticgraphs.org/>
4. Apparatus: <http://aprt.us/>
5. Joy.js: <http://ncase.me/joy/>
6. Tangle: <http://worrydream.com/Tangle/>
7. g9: <http://omrelli.ug/g9/gallery/>
8. Loopy: <http://ncase.me/loopy/>
9. All Explorable Tools: <https://explorabl.es/tools/>
10. APL: <https://tryapl.org>
11. p5.js: <https://p5.js.org>
12. Math in Motion. <https://math-in-motion.github.io/early-demo/>
13. Reanimate: Build declarative animations with SVG and Haskell
 <https://reanimate.github.io>
14. <https://animejs.com>
15. p5.teach.js. <https://two-ticks.github.io/p5.teach.js/>. Includes anime.js in a p5.js library.




## Abstract and Course Contents

The intent of this course is to provide a brief quick introduction to several different tools that help to create interactive diagrams, web pages, scrollies to explain ideas and concepts better. 

Hopefully each module will also contain a simple but complete process on tools and how to install, integrate, and use them in a non-intimidating way. 

Since I am used to `R + RStudio + Hugo/Quarto + Github + Netlify` workflow, I will try my best to see if I can use any of these tools in that workflow. The best case would be:

- Simply invoke the specific tool in an RMarkdown or Quarto document. Today *Observable* is easily doable; Idyll also seems to be possible. 
- Pass data and variables seamlessly between multiple modules
- They must not clash, these tools and give me hell like with *htmlwidgets* in R which was a miserable experience up to now. (Though it seems to be changing with Quarto..hmm, time to revisit)
- Another very promising workflow is to simply use `p5.js`. This allows inclusion of a huge collection of teaching oriented libraries, and `p5.js` sketches are easily embedded in Quarto. (This may end up being my default workflow, and will allow me to keep R things and js things separate!)
