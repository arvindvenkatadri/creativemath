The earlier editions\nare here: [**Lawrence of\nArabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ \"https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/\")\nand\n[**Spotify**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/ \"https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/\").\n\nThis is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative\nThinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,\nover the past 8 years or more at the [**Srishti Manipal Institute of\nArt, Design, and Technology, Bangalore\nINDIA.**](https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in \"https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in\")\n\n# Power from your Balcony\n\nWhat do you think of this innovation?\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61582c79a4c757037f07d954/619f661b6eb56f4b40e1f5fc_uk-o-wind-turbine-3_digi-p-1080.jpeg)\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HHJ0rt5xwg >}}\n\n\n\nThis solution to urban \"micro-power\" generation has won numerous awards,\nmost notably the [James Dyson Award in\n2018](https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/2018/project/o-wind-turbine/). The\ninventors are [Nicolas\nOrellana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicorellana/) and [Yaseen\nNoorani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseen-noorani-b5402a79/?originalSubdomain=uk).\n\nWithout further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable\ninvention.\n\n## A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as\n[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ \"https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/\"):\n\n-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source\n    TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k \"Open Source TRIZ on YouTube\")**,**\n    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation\n\n-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /\n    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.\n\n-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and\n    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive\n    Principles.\n\n-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power **consumption\ncenters** are the urban areas and these are far away from the\n**generation sites**. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these\ncosts.\n\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around\nthe home? Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify\nthe *Parameters* of this Problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_4b450608c495ef494861c70591e0b19b'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=4200}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them\noff and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up\nseveral problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked\nsome of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and\nnot direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that\nsome these may sound very naive, but that is way to start!\n\n1.  I would like to have access the the OWind but it needs to be not too\n    close to the walls for it to harness the wind?\n2.  How to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection\n    wires get twisted? ( (Do I need a\n    \\[commutator\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator\\_(electric))\n    like arrangement?)\n\nas an [**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp \"https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp\")\nin *plain English*:\n\n> <center>**AC**: We wish to pull out plastics from the **river**\n> without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational /\n> transportation )</center>\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa\nDiagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ *Ideal Final Result*:\n\n> <center>**IFR**:The River must flow. The Plastics must not.</center>\n\nShort and pithy.\n\nWe could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our\nfocus was. (Our focus here is the **river)**. The way we would look at\nthe Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case.\nMore on this in just a bit!\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,\nkeeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in\nthe\n[**TRIZ**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)[**Contradiction**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf \"Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003\")[**Matrix**\n**(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which\nParameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what\nwe can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^1]:\n\n> **- TC 1**: Increase `Volume of Stationary Object`(8) and not worsen\n> `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40)\n>\n> **- TC 2**: Improve `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40) and not\n> worsen `Volume of Stationary Object`(8)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects\nthat we choose the make the **river** our focus. We want to increase the\n`volume` of the stationary plastic **in the river**, while not worsening\nthe `harmful effects` acting on the **river**. Note how the IFR is\nincluded here, in using the word **stationary** for the object: the\nplastic must **not** flow, while the river **must**.\n\nAs stated in my previous articles ( [**Lawrence of\nArabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ \"Lawrence of Arabia: A TRIZ Analysis\")\nand\n[**Spotify**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/ \"TRIZ Analysis of a Recent Spotify Ad\")),\nthere is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative\ninterpretations of the AC, using the *language of TRIZ*, the **48\nParameters** in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the\nTRIZ Matrix can be thought of as *metaphors* for the knobs that lie\nwithin our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making\nmetaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter\n`Amount of Substance (10)` i.e. the plastic *on the river*, as the\n\"metaphoric thing\" to improve but the current IFR speaks of the\n**river**. Or we could choose `Aesthetics and Appearance (39)` as our\ntarget, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed\nmanner. TRIZ tends to [**focus our\nattention**](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kahneman/files/attention_hi_quality.pdf \"Daniel Kahneman\")\nlike no other method that I know of.\n\nWe could also formulate a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^2]:\n\n> <center>**PC**: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River\n> at the same time.</center>\n\nwhich is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is\nformulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and\nPC.\n\n## Solving the Technical Contradiction\n\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive\nat the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution\nfor `TC-1` in the figure below; The square for solutions to `TC-1` has\nbeen circled in red.\n\n![](matrix.png)\n\nHere is what the Matrix suggests:\n\nFor `TC-1`:\n\n1.  39(Inert Atmosphere)\n\n2.  24(Intermediary)\n\n3.  19(Periodic Action)\n\n4.  27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (**!!**)\n\n    and with `TC-2`:\n\n5.  5(Merging)\n\n6.  17(Another Dimension)\n\n7.  ~~39(Inert Atmosphere)~~\n\n8.  ~~19(Periodic Action)~~\n\nThis is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these\nInventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we\n*Generalized Solutions* we try to map these back into the Problem at\nhand:\n\n-   **(39)Inert Atmosphere**: Hmm...what can be inert in the River? What\n    could \"inert\" mean here? The River should be inert...so must not\n    flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!\n-   **24(Intermediary)**: OK, something between the River and the\n    Plastic. But...we don't want nets or dams or weirs...then what? Need\n    to think!!\n-   **19(Periodic Action)**: What can be \"periodic\" in the River? Waves?\n    But how do we **make** waves? Need to think some more!!\n-   **27(Cheap Short Living Objects)**: What can be cheap short and\n    short living in the River water? Not fish, surely...wait,\n    **BUBBLES**!!!\n\nSo (breathlessly): we create bubbles in the water and use them as an\n*Intermediary* to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we\nwant it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both *Inert*\n**and** *Atmosphere*, literally! And they are *Cheap* and *Short-Lived*\nso we need to regenerate them *Periodically!* We can periodically\n*sweep* the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb\nany other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!\n\n**5(Merging)** is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect.\n**17(Another Dimension)** is also evocative and powerful as a Solution:\nthe River flows **horizontally** but the barrier we need to create is\n**vertical**. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles\n**dissolve in the River water** (assuming **another dimension,** as it\nwere) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains\ndo!!\n\nSo there you have it! It seems that [**Going\nDutch**](https://thegreatbubblebarrier.com/ \"The Great Bubble Barrier\")\neven with bubbles, is a good idea !\n\n## Using TRIZ Separation Principles\n\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**\nparameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*\nfor example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.\n\nOur IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to\nflow at the same time. But the Plastics are\n[**in**](https://christophertyler.org/CWTyler/AlicePDFs/13treacle.pdf \"The Treacle Well ( Alice in Wonderland )\")\nthe River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!\n\nCan we make the River \"less of a River\" in places? Can we make\n**separate** zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to\nharvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as **(39)Inert\nAtmosphere** and **24(Intermediary)** suggest such a \"spatial\"\nseparation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a\nPhysical Contradiction related to \"time\". TRIZ offers us a smaller and\nmore easily \"memorizable\" set of metaphoric solutions in the form of\n**Separation Principles**. Here they are:\n\n-   [Separation in Time]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation in Space]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation on Condition]{.smallcaps}\n-   [Separation between Parts and the Whole]{.smallcaps}\n\nNote that while these *Separation Principles* are just a handful to\nmemorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway.\nBut then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles\nin the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew\nto a particular kind of *Separation* *Principle.*\n\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ,\nplease send me a DM!
