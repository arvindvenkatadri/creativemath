They should be either\nblack, [brindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brindle \"Brindle\") or\nseal with white markings.[^2] Boston Terriers are small and compact with\na short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent\nand very easily trained.[^3] They are friendly and can be stubborn at\ntimes. The average life span of a Boston Terrier is around 11 to 13\nyears.[^4] The American Kennel Club ranked the Boston Terrier as the\n21st most popular breed in 2019.[^5]\n\n## History\n\n::: {layout=\"[[30, 70], [100]]\"}\n![Terrier\nSeated](../materials/images/Terrier_Seated_(Boston_Public_Library).jpeg){width=\"50%\"}\n\nThe Boston terrier breed originated around 1875, when Robert C. Hooper\nof Boston purchased from [Edward\nBurnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burnett \"Edward Burnett\")\na dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which was of a bull\nand terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is directly related to the\noriginal [bull and\nterrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_and_terrier \"Bull and terrier\")\nbreeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The [American Kennel\nClub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club \"American Kennel Club\")\ncites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of all true modern Boston Terriers.\nJudge weighed about 32 pounds (15 kg).\n\nJudge was bred to Burnett's Gyp (or Kate). Gyp was a white bulldog-type\nfemale, owned by Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts. She\nweighed about 20 pounds (9.1 kg), was stocky and strong and had the\ntypical blocky head now shown in Bostons. From this foundation of the\nbreed, subsequent breeders refined the breed into its modern day\npresentation. Bred down in size from [fighting\ndogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dog_fighting_breeds \"List of dog fighting breeds\")\nof the bull and terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up\nto 44 pounds (20 kg) (Old Boston Bulldogs).\n:::\n\n![A young male Boston Terrier with a Brown brindle\ncoat](../materials/images/330px-Boston_Terrier_male.jpeg){.column-margin}\n\nThe breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had\nbecome sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American\nBull Terrier Club, the breed's nickname, \"roundheads\". Shortly after, at\nthe suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club\nchanged its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted\nto membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US\nbreed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have\noriginated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first\nnon-sporting dog breed in the US.\n\nIn the early years, the color and markings were not very important to\nthe breed's standard. By the 20th century the breed's distinctive\nmarkings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential\nfeature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature,\npreferring the company of humans, although some males will still\nchallenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded.\n[Boston\nUniversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University \"Boston University\")\nhas used [Rhett the Boston\nTerrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_the_Boston_Terrier \"Rhett the Boston Terrier\")\nas their mascot since 1922. [Wofford\nCollege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wofford_College \"Wofford College\")\nin [Spartanburg,\nSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartanburg,_South_Carolina \"Spartanburg, South Carolina\")\nhas had a live Boston Terrier mascot named Blitz since 2003 that attends\nhome football games. The Boston Terrier has also been the official state\ndog of\n[Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts \"Massachusetts\")\nsince 1979.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a\nsquare-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The\n[muzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout \"Snout\") is short and\ngenerally\n[wrinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle \"Wrinkle\")-free, with an\neven or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the\n[tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail \"Tail\") is short. According to\ninternational breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25\npounds (11 kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15--17 inches\n(380--430 mm) at the\n[withers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withers \"Withers\").\n\nThe American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15\npounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25\npounds.\n\n### **Coat and color**\n\nThe Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion\nto either black,\n[brindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brindle \"Brindle\"), seal (color\nof a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the bright\nsun), or a combination of the three. Any other color is not accepted as\na Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually\nobtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its\ncharacteristic \"tuxedo\" appearance.[^6] Any Boston Terrier from AKC\nparentage regardless of the color, or if it is a splash or has a blue\neye or weak ears, can be and are registered by the AKC and participate\nin any AKC sporting events.\n\n![A female Boston Terrier with a black\ncoat](../materials/images/330px-Boston_Terrier_Eden_Forever.jpeg){.column-margin}\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the Boston Terrier's markings are\nbroken down into two categories: Required, which consists of a white\nchest, white muzzle band, and a white band between the eyes; and\nDesired, which includes the Required markings plus a white collar, white\non the forelegs,\n[forelegs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelimb \"Forelimb\"), up to the\n[hocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hock_(zoology) \"Hock (zoology)\")\non the [rear legs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hind_limb \"Hind limb\").\nFor [conformation\nshowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformation_show \"Conformation show\"),\nsymmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier's markings\nresembling [formal\nwear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_wear \"Formal wear\"), in\naddition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly\nreferred to as \"the American Gentleman.\"\n\n![An adult male Boston Terrier with a black\ncoat](../materials/images/330px-BostonTerrier001.jpeg){.column-margin}\n\n## Temperament\n\nBoston Terrier is a gentle breed that typically has a strong,\nhappy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humor.\nBoston Terriers are generally eager to please their owner and can be\neasily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may\nresult in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and\nstrangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.\n\nWhile originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment\nfactories, they were later bred for companionship. They are not\nconsidered terriers by the American Kennel Club, however, but are part\nof the non-sporting group.\n\nBoth females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary,\nTheir usually sensible attitude toward barking makes them excellent\nchoices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get\nalong well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine\npets, if properly socialized.\n\n## Grooming\n\nWith a short, shiny, smooth coat, Boston Terriers require little\ngrooming. Bostons produce light shedding, and weekly brushing of their\nfine coat is effective at removing loose hair. Brushing promotes the\nhealth of the coat because it distributes skin oils, and it also\nencourages new hair growth. Occasional bathing is suitable for the\nbreed.[^7]\n\nThe nails of Boston Terriers require regular trimming. Overgrown nails\nnot only have the potential to inflict pain on the breed, but they can\nalso make walking difficult or tear off after getting snagged on\nsomething.\n\nSimilarly to nail trimming, tooth brushing should also be done regularly\nto promote good oral health. The risk of the breed developing oral pain,\ngum infection, or bad breath can be decreased with regular tooth\nbrushing that removes plaque buildup and other bacteria. In addition,\npoor dental hygiene can lead to tooth root abscesses that can lead to\ndamage around the tissue and eventually lead to the loss of teeth.\n\n[^1]: Meade, Scottee (2000).
