(Or, at least, love in the first\nfour minutes?)\n\nThis dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray\nFisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper [**Gender Differences in Mate\nSelection: Evidence From a Speed\nDatingExperiment**](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/866/racialPreferences.pdf).\n\nData was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events\nfrom 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four\nminute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At\nthe end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would\nlike to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on\nsix attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition,\nand Shared Interests.\n\n## What is the Story here?\n\n1.  Do people prefer to date someone from their own *race*?\n2.  Is that different for men and women?\n3.  Does physical attractiveness help to overcome age differences?\n\n## A Workflow in Orange\n\n## A Workflow in Radiant\n\n## A Workflow in R\n",
