Inner Product Computation\n\nLet us start by dividing up 2D space ( for now!!) into square-shaped cells. At each vertex we randomly place a [**unit gradient vector**]{.purple} labelled $r_{i}$ that points in a random direction. See the figure below:\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"780px\" height=\"600px\" src=\"https://editor.p5js.org/arvindv/full/6CosUsBQt\">\n</iframe>\n</center>\n\nWe wish to calculate the Perlin Noise amount at [any point of interest]{.green} inside the cell. \n\n- We draw [difference vectors to the point]{.red} from each of the 4 vertices. \n- We compute the vector **dot product** with each of the $r_{i}$ and the above difference vectors. ( 4 dot products )\n- These are shown in the text print at the side of the figure.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Dot Products are Scalars with Polarity\nNote how the 4 dot products change as you move the mouse/touchpad. This changes the 4 gradient vectors and hence the scalar dot products change in amplitude **and** polarity. \n\nIn a typical Perlin Noise implementation, the gradient vectors are **fixed** after an initial setup. So each gradient vector generates a range of dot-product values as the point of interest moves within the cell. \n\n:::\n\n#### B. Interpolation of Dot Product values\n\nWith the 4 scalar dot products, we are now ready to compute the Perlin Noise value at the point of interest. There are several ways of doing this:\n\n- Simply take the average\n- Take a **weighted** average, with fixed weights.\n- Use a wieghting/interpolating function: The closer a point of interest is to one or other of the cell vertices, the higher is the contribution of the corresponding dot-product. \n\nThe third approach is the one embedded within (all?) Perlin Noise implementations. The interpolating function is:\n$$\nf(t) = 6t^5-15t^4+10t^3\n$$\nand looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::

Fractal Overlay and Combining\n\nNow that we have one grid full of a *layer* of noise generated by weighted dot-products, we can appreciate one more thing: we can overlay the space with **several layers** of such noise values. Why would this be a good idea?\n\nThis multiple layer overlay creates a very natural-looking **fractal-ness** in the resulting noise function. Most natural looking shapes like landscapes, mountains, vegetables, flames...all have this *self-similar* structure where when one zooms in, the magnified function looks pretty much like the un-zoomed version!!\n\nSo how we create and merge overlays? We create several more-closely-spaced grids, and generate noise in the same way. These layers of noise-s are scaled by a factor (Usually $\\frac{1}{2^n}$), where $n$ is the \"order\"of the layer. Each new finely-spaced layer generates similar-looking noise functions, which are combined with smaller and smaller weights to achieve that final polished fractal look of Perlin Noise. \n\nWe will explore this fractality with code.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify ph chart-scatter-bold >}} Creating Textures and Waveforms with Perlin Noise\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style=\"background: whitesmoke;\"}\n\n### Using p5.js\n\n\n### Using R\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1. <https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/procedural-generation-virtual-worlds/perlin-noise-part-2/perlin-noise.html>\n\n1. <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-noise/a/perlin-noise>\n\n1. <https://adrianb.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html>\n\n1. <https://www.arendpeter.com/Perlin_Noise.html>\n\n1. <https://mzucker.github.io/html/perlin-noise-math-faq.html>\n\n\n1. <https://betterexplained.com/articles/vector-calculus-understanding-the-dot-product/>\n\n\n\n::: {#refs style=\"font-size: 60%;\"}\n###### {{< iconify lucide package-check >}} R Package Citations\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nPackage      Version   Citation    \n-----------  --------  ------------\nambient      1.0.2     @ambient    \nmosaicCalc   0.6.4     @mosaicCalc \nplot3D       1.4.1     @plot3D     \n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n",
