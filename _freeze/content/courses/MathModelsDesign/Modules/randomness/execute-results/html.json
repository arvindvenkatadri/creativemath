Let us first examine the street traffic data we have gathered for\n    any \"model-like\" pattern!\n\nWe will use a tool called, umm....**WTFcsv**. Let us first quickly see\nwhat this tool offers us!\n\n<br> `{{% vimeo \"150216437\" %}}`{=html} <br>\n\nLet us import our data into the **WTFcsv** tool [(**Web\nLink**)](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/) and see what patterns lurk\nbeneath our data!\n\n2.  Let us throw some chalk or Lego pieces on the floor at random and\n    see what happens!!\n\n### Is Randomness a Design Tool, then?\n\n![Photo by Sharath G. from Pexels](pexels-sharath-g-4418675.jpg)\n\n1.  Do you remember plucking mangoes from the trees in your childhood\n    gardens?\\\n2.  Did you happen to be the youngest in the group?\n3.  Did you have run home to get the salt + chilly powder?\n4.  Why did you trust your friends not to eat off the best mangoes in\n    your absence? ;-D\n5.  Were you used to being the \"*denner*\" in every game?\n6.  Was that a completely \"mad\" thing to do, throwing stuff on the\n    floor? Or was it an act of *Pedagogical Vandalism*?\n7.  Is Randomness just too much to handle or comprehend?\n8.  Or can we \"tame\" it in some way, and put it to use in Art, Design,\n    and Tech?\n9.  Have we been doing this all along? Have we been \"*holding infinity\n    in the palm of our hands*\"[^1], in the हाथ कीे लकीरे?\n10. What diagrams or thought experiments can we create to do this?\n11. WHY would this be a good idea? Is there a very **Human Motivation**\n    behind this desire we might have?\n\n[^1]: William Blake, *Auguries of Innocence*,\n    <https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence>\n\nCould this song indicate what our situation might be?\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qan0Y9hXpPQ>\n\n<https://www.filmyquotes.com/songs/1381>\n\nWell, perhaps not entirely ;-D\n\n### Hamlet is also like us !!\n\nLet us read the famous nunnery scene from **Hamlet**:\n\na)  Hamlet in 4 Minutes:\\\n    <br> `{{% youtube \"EmjWIMMtjDc\" %}}`{=html} <br>\n\nb)  *To be or Not to be*: [(Web\n    Link)](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be/)\n\nWhat was Hamlet's problem? How did he solve that problem?\n\n### Suppose we were Hamlet....\n\nWhat would we want to know?\n\n-   Who is our friend?\n-   What is the chance that we will survive?\n-   Who killed Dad?\n\nDid Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to\nprove? Yes, he did, and that is why he *feigned madness*, so people\nwould open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was\n[*craft in his madness*](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html).\n\nIf we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, or a\n**Hypothesis** that we had, then we would need to conduct an\n\"Experiment\", rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or **feigning\nmadness** of course. But there is a **Madness to the Method**, as we\nwill see...\n\n![\"Design of Experiments - A Workflow: A Madness in the\nMethod\"](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/ppdac.png)\n\nFrom\n[StatsRef](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/?statistics__statistical_analys.html)\n:\n\n> The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem\n> definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions --- this is typically not\n> the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a\n> series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is\n> shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise\n> sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often\n> will feed back to the previous stage.\n\n> In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the\n> reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining\n> expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions\n> (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues,\n> step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the\n> implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.\n\n### Design of Experiments\n\nLet us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out\nsome \"truth\" (highly probable idea) that is important to us.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet us consider the **Short Term Memory(STM)** of Foundation Students;\nOr , we could use the **Guilford Divergent Thinking Test for Alternative\nUses** as our vehicle for testing similar Hypotheses:\n\n-   STM scores are significantly different between students of Design\n    and those of Art (;-O)\n-   Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more\n    like parameters of STM itself, such as:\n    -   Word complexity (Syllables per Word)\n    -   No of Words\n    -   Exposure Time and Recall Time\n-   Students who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in\n    Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration,\n    Originality)\n-   There is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between\n    students from \"small towns\" and those from metros.\n\n#### Factors\n\nIn each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are *binary*\n(two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: `Art vs Design`,\n`Speaks Mother Tongue or Not`, `Small Town vs Metro`,\n`Long vs Short List of Words`, `Short vs Long Words` and\n`Long vs Short Exposure`.\n\nIf we want our experiment to be **fair** we must have:\n\n-   Devise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (*Test\n    Type*)\n\n-   the **same number** of subjects for each Test Type\n\n-   **randomly** select the people as *respondents* each Test Type\n\nWe will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the\n**PPDAC Method** to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence\nto guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:\n**Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to\nStatistics** [(**Weblink to\nPDF**)](Lawrence%20-%20A%20Design%20of%20Experiments%20Workshop%20as%20an%20Introduction%20to%20Statistics.pdf).\nThis is the paper describing a simple *Design of Experiments* workshop\nin class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can.\nDo read through this in the evening today in preparation for our\nexperiment.\n\n### Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv\n\nOnce our test is complete, let us collate all the data for all tests\nusing Excel. (This is for the STM Hypothesis; we can adapt this\nspreadsheet for any other hypothesis test with categorical factors and\nscores.)\n\n1.  Download this [**spreadsheet**](STM.xlsx) and save as your own\n    *named* local copy.\n2.  Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled \"RawData\"\n    (the one with the warning)\n3.  **Duplicate this data** on the sheet titled \"Data Duplicated\". **Do\n    not touch** the \"RawData\" sheet again.\n4.  For each of the *factors* under consideration, we will need to stack\n    up STM scores from $2^3 = 8$ tests, i.e. eight columns.\n5.  If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three\n    sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.\n6.  Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one *level*\n    of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the\n    other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may\n    have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example\n    below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from *4* tests for\n    each *level* of the parameter *p1*.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='randomness_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_e7457e04fda8f1a1f20504fa65591278'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"scores\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"test\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"p1\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"p2\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"p3\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"A\",\"3\":\"True\",\"4\":\"Long\",\"5\":\"Big\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"B\",\"3\":\"True\",\"4\":\"Long\",\"5\":\"Small\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"C\",\"3\":\"True\",\"4\":\"Short\",\"5\":\"Big\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"D\",\"3\":\"True\",\"4\":\"Short\",\"5\":\"Small\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"E\",\"3\":\"False\",\"4\":\"Long\",\"5\":\"Big\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"F\",\"3\":\"False\",\"4\":\"Long\",\"5\":\"Small\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"G\",\"3\":\"False\",\"4\":\"Short\",\"5\":\"Big\"},{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"H\",\"3\":\"False\",\"4\":\"Short\",\"5\":\"Small\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](randomness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1.  We will set up each of these *two stacked-score columns* in Col A on\n    separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled\n    \"Permutation Test\". One sheet for each two-valued parameter.\n2.  Create *paired* Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns\n    using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that\n    there are *TWO* Histograms: one for each value of the factor under\n    consideration.\n3.  Inspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms\n    may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any\n    effect on STM scores or none.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='randomness_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_78ce231261b158bb19af4603f1415fed'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](randomness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n4.  Save these 6 histograms as PNG files on your machines and use them\n    along with *Comic Generator* (discussed below) to tell the story of\n    your Hypothesis Testing.\n\n### Computing Parallel Worlds: The Permutation Test\n\nWhat is we cannot trust our eyes to compare the pair-wise Histograms?\n\nIf there was considerable overlap?\n\nIs there a better way? Yes by playing another Childhood Game, with **a\ndeck of cards** !!!\n\n#### Before we play with cards, some background\n\nFrom: Tim C. Hesterberg (2015) *What Teachers Should Know About the\nBootstrap: Resampling in the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum*, The\nAmerican Statistician, 69:4, 371-386, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789\n\n> Student B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there\n> were more commercials in the \"basic\" TV channels, the ones that come\n> with a cable TV subscription, than in the \"extended\" channels you pay\n> extra for.

He\n> measured an average of 9.21 minutes of commercials per half hour in\n> the basic channels, vs only 6.87 minutes in the extended channels.\n> This seems to support his hypothesis. But there is not much\n> data---perhaps the difference was just random. The poor guy could only\n> stand to watch 20 random half hours of TV. Actually, he didn't even do\n> that---he got his girlfriend to watch half of it. (Are you as appalled\n> by the deluge of commercials as I am?

We will execute on Permutation Test on one sheet step by step and\n    decide whether that factor had a significant *effect* on STM scores.\n2.  We **pretend** that there is no difference in scores whether the\n    factor is chosen on way or another.\n3.  We **mechanize this pretence** by lumping \"both kinds\" of scores\n    together and shuffle them and divide them, **randomly** into two\n    groups, and take the difference in scores.\n4.  We can do this, like we did with our Monte Carlo experiment, many\n    many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like\n    inventing many parallel worlds)\n5.  If we look at the way these **randomly computed** scores are\n    distributed and **compare** with the one measurement we did see, we\n    can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able\n    to mimic the Mom.\n6.  If we are **not** able to mimic Mom, then **Mom always knows** and\n    we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under\n    consideration. Else, nope.\n7.  Replicate this test for the other (binary) factors.\n\nApropos: how could we do this for non-binary factors ...??!!!\n\n### Making a Data Comic out of our Experiment\n\nWhat have been our Conclusions with the Experiment?
