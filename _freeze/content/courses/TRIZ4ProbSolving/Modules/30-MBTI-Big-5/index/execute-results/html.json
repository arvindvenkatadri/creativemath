We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.\n\n## Icebreaker Game!\n\nLook at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:  \n\n- *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers   \n- Raise your hand when you have done so. \n\n\n## A Personality Game\n\nI have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:  \n\n- Discuss how to complete the Task  \n- Complete the Task and document your work  \n- *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.   \n- Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team  \n\n\n## References\n\n1.

MBTI Game: [PDF](/pdf/MBTI Activities.pdf)\n\n## Why does this Matter to Us\n\nFrom the two exercises, we see that:  \n- reality really matters upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view.  \n- We all have our \"default modes\" for behaviour  \n- As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better. \n",
