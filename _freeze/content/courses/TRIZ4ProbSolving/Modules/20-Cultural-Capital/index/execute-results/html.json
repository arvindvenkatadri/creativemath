Cultural Capital\n<br>\n\n{{< youtube 5DBEYiBkgp8 >}}\n\n\n\n\n## Activities\n\n### Sharing\n\n1. Sharing of CC: we will each of us take turns to reveal some aspect of Cultural Capital that we directly possess: **Objectified**, **Institutional**, and **Embodied**\n\n### Re-Inventing your Own Game\n\n1. You will be divided into Teams. Each Team needs to chose a wellknown parlour/household or board game from your childhood. Set it up and play it. \n1. Then, you will be given a piece of Electronic Hardware called a **Makey-Makey**. You will need to include this hardware in your Game and extend the Game in a certain way.\n\n::: callout-note\n## TRIZ Concept: Su-Field Analysis\nWe will later tie this activity to the TRIZ idea of *Substance-Field Analysis*. Perhaps you have a premonitory idea about this already?\n:::\n\n\n### Inventing your City\n\n1. Making a Street Intersection Logo\n\nLet us take inspiration from this website:\n<https://www.cartogrammar.com/blog/maps-make-the-best-logos/>\n\n2. Here are some instructions:\\\n\n  - Visit your home town on Google Maps\n  - Select a specific STREET INTERSECTION there.\n  - Copy paste the Shape of the Street Intersection into your favourite image making software\n  - Create A LOGO for your city, using the Shape, such that you show off some interesting aspects of your City, based on your own CULTURAL CAPITAL.\n  - Three sentences to describe your Logo.\n  - See examples at the link above for inspiration\n  \n::: callout-note\n## Serendipity\nThis course is about nothing if not about *serendipity*. <https://www.dictionary.com/browse/serendipity>.\nWe will connect this logo building idea with the idea of Metaphors in TRIZ.\n:::\n\n## References\n\n1.
