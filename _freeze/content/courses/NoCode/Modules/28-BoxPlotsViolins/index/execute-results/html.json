The internal process of this plot is as follows:\n\n  - make groups of the Quant variable for each level of the Qual\n  - in each group, rank the Quant variable values in increasing order\n  - Calculate: `median`, `IQR`, `outliers`\n  - plot these as a vertical or horizontal box structure\n\nThe box  can also be asymmetric \"half plots\" if needed...\n\n::: callout-note\n### Histograms and Box Plots\nNote how the histogram that dwells upon the mean and standard deviation, whereas the boxplot focuses on the median and quartiles.\nThe former uses the *values* of the Quant variable, whereas the latter uses their *sequence* or *rank*. \n:::\n\nBox plots are often used for example in HR operations to understand Salary distributions across grades of employees. Marks of students in competitive exams are also declared using Quartiles. \n\n![Box Plot and Density](../../../../materials/images/Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg){#fig-boxplot-density}\n\nIn the @fig-boxplot-density, the boxplot is compared with a *density plot*, which shows a **symmetric** normal density. Since the latter is symmetric, the `median` and the `mean` are identical, as seen by the correspondence with the boxplot above it. \n\n\n::: {#fig-boxplots-with-skewness layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Box Plot and Skewness](../../../../materials/images/Boxplots_with_skewness.png){#fig-three-boxplots}\n\n\n![Density and Skewness](../../../../materials/images/Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png){#fig-distribution-skewness}\n\n\nBox Plot Discussions\n\n:::\n\n\nIn the @fig-three-boxplots, we see the difference between boxplots that show *symmetric* and *skewed* distributions. The \"lid\" and the \"bottom\" of the box are not of similar width in distributions with significant skewness. \n\nCompare these with the corresponding @fig-distribution-skewness.\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify carbon box-plot >}} {{< iconify carbon chart-violin-plot >}} Quick Box Plots in Orange\n\nHere is the [BoxPlot Widget description](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/boxplot/).\n\nLet us first plot a set of boxplots for the familiar `iris` dataset and then investigate other datasets using the same Orange workflow. \n\n{{< downloadthis orange/boxplots.ows dname=\"boxplots\" label=\"Download the BoxPlot Workflow file\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n![Iris Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/iris-boxplot-light.png){#fig-iris-boxplot}\n\n@fig-iris-boxplot shows the three horizontal box-plots for the chosen Quant variable, one for each *level* of `iris`(species). The IQR is also shown for each fo the groups. One can selectively compare either medians or means across these groups of measurements. \n\n## {{< iconify uiw pay >}} Dataset: Salaries in Academia\n\nLet us examine this dataset in Orange.\n\n\n{{< downloadthis data/salaries.csv dname=\"salaries\" label=\"Download the Salaries data\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data\n\n![Salaries Data Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-data-table.png){#fig-salaries-data-table}\n\n@fig-salaries-data-table states that there are 397 teachers, with 6 variables in the dataset.\n\n\n![SalariesData Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-summary-table.png){#fig-salaries-summary-table}\n\n\n### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary\n\n::: callout-note\n### Quantitative Data\n\n-   `salary`: (int) (Annual) Salary!\n-   `yrs_service`: (int) No. of Years they have served as teachers\n-   `yrs_since_phd`: (int) No. of Years after their PhD. (sigh)\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n### Qualitative Data\n\n-   `discipline`: (chr) Nature of Expertise\n-   `rank`: (chr) Nature of Appointment\n-   `sex`: (chr) Male / Female. Note the imbalance in the counts!!\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n### Qual and Quant...\nCan any of the Quant variables be thought of as *Quant* variables? When, under what circumstances?\n\n:::\n\n### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions\n\nLet's try a few questions and see if they are answerable with Box Plots and Violins\n\n::: callout-note\n## Question\nQ1. What is the distribution of `salary`? If we split by `sex`?\n\n::: {#fig-netflix-histograms layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Salaries Box Plot](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-boxplot-single.png){#fig-salaries-boxplot}\n\n\n![Salaries Box Plot by Sex](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-boxplot-by-sex.png){#fig-salaries-by-sex}\n\nSalaries Data Box Plots\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Question\nQ2. What is the distribution of `salary`, when we split by other Qual variables, such as `rank`?\n\n![Salaries Box Plot by Sex](../../../../materials/images/Orange/salaries-by-rank.png){#fig-salaries-by-rank}\n\n:::\n\n\n### {{< iconify game-icons secret-book >}} What is the Story Here?\n\nSalaries have quite a wide distribution with some very highly paid individuals ( ~ $240K), while the median is still $107K. So some people are more than 2X the median!\n\nWhen split by `sex`, we get *two* box plots that show the differences between group salaries. The means and medians are quite different between the two groups, an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical t-test*]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}. \n\nWhen split by `rank``, we get *three* box plots that show the differences between group salaries, again an important inference that needs to be completely verified by a [*statistical ANOVA test*]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}. \n\n## {{< iconify ic outline-gpp-good>}} Are the Differences Significant?\n\n::: callout-important\n## t-test for two categories\nWhen comparing **mean** salaries vs sex in @fig-salaries-by-sex, note the annotation below the graph. This is the result of the [*t-test*]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}:\n\n$$ Student's ~ t: 3.198~(p = 0.002, ~ N = 397) $$\n\nThis indicates several things:\n\n- That the `t-statistic` is 3.198;\n- If we [**assume** `sex` makes no difference to `salary`]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is low $p = 0.002$;\n- And of course that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate. \n\nThe test states that this difference **is statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it. \n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n### ANOVA test for more than 2 levels\nNow observe the boxplots and annotations in @fig-salaries-by-rank, where again we compare **mean** salaries vs `rank`. This is the result of the [*ANOVA-test*]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}:\n\n$$ ANOVA: ~ 128.217~~(p = 0.000, ~ N = 397) $$\n\nThis indicates several things:\n\n- That the ANOVA `F-statistic` is 128.217;\n- If we [**assume** `rank` makes no difference to `salary`]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}, then the probability that this difference could arise merely by chance is negligible $p = 0.000$;\n- And again that there $397$ data points to vouch for this estimate.\n\nThe ANOVA test states that the (multiple) differences **are statistically significant** and could be used to justify further actions based upon it. \n\nFor the intrepid, here is a brief, diagrammed, and [intuitive explanation of ANOVA.](../../../Analytics/Inference/Modules/130-ThreeMeansOrMore/ANOVA.qmd#workflow-anova). Note that the `t-test` and `ANOVA` are identical tests, the former being used for 2-level comparisons of means, and the latter for comparisons of more than 2 means. \n\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn\n\nHere are a couple of datasets that you might want to analyze with box plots, and even perform `t-tests` and `ANOVA-tests`:\n\n1. Insurance Data\n\n{{< downloadthis data/insurance.csv dname=\"insurance\" label=\"Download the Insurance data\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n1. Political Donations\n\n{{< downloadthis data/donations.csv dname=\"donations\" label=\"Download the Donations data\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\n- Box plots are a  powerful statistical graphic that give us a combined view of data ranges, quartiles, medians, and outliers. \n- Box plots can compare `groups` within our Quant variable, based on `levels` of a Qual variable.\n- They are ideal for visualizing statistical tests for difference in *mean* values across groups (t-test and ANOVA).\n- In your design research, you would have numerical Quant data that is accompanied by categorical Qual data pertaining to your target audience. Analysing for **differences** in the Quant across levels of the Qual is a vital step in justifying time, effort, and money for further actions in your project. \n\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
