(Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?) \n\nThis dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper [**Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment**](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/866/racialPreferences.pdf). \n\nData was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.\n\n\n## What is the Story here?\n\n1. Do people prefer to date someone from their own *race*? \n1. Is that different for men and women?\n1. Does physical attractiveness help to overcome age differences?  \n\n\n",
