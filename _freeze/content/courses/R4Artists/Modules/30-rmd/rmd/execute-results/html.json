We can check if all is in order\nby running a check in the `Terminal` in RStudio.\n![](/content/materials/images/quarto-check.png)\n\nThe commands are:\n\n1.  `quarto check install`\n2.  `quarto check knitr`\n\nIf these come out with no errors then we are ready to fire up our first\nQuarto document.\n\n## Practice\n\nFire up a new Quarto document by going to:\n`File -> New File -> Quarto Document.`Switch to `Visual` mode, if it is\nnot already there.\n\nUse the visual mode tool bar.\n\n![](/content/materials/images/visual-toolbar.png)Try to create\n`Sections`, `code chunks`, `embedding images` and `tables`.\n\nHit the `Render` button to see how the documents is converted into an\n`html` document.\n\n## References:\n\n1.  <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html>\n\n2.  <https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/slides/01-basics.html> Nice\n    RMarkdown presentation and *\"code movies\"* !\n\n3.  <https://www.markdowntutorial.com>\n\n4.  https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n## Assignment(s)\n\n1.
