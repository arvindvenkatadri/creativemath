We will be following a\nvery intuitive `package` in R, called `flexdashboard`. This package\nallows us to make Posters that include code, analysis, description, and\nof course pictures to weave a convincing story for upper management!\n\n# FlexDashboard\n\nWe will use the `flexdashboard` package to create our reports.\n\n> Highlights of the flexdashboard package include:\n>\n> -   Support for a wide variety of **components** including interactive\n>     **htmlwidgets; base, lattice, and grid graphics; tabular data;\n>     gauges; and value boxes**.\n> -   Flexible and easy to specify **row and column-based layouts**.\n>     Components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and\n>     adapted for display on mobile devices.\n> -   Extensive support for **text annotations** to include assumptions,\n>     contextual narrative, and analysis within dashboards.\n> -   **Storyboard layouts** for presenting sequences of visualizations\n>     and related commentary.\n> -   By default dashboards are standard HTML documents that can be\n>     deployed on any web server or even attached to an email message.\n>     You can optionally add Shiny components for additional\n>     interactivity and then deploy on Shiny Server or shinyapps.io.\n\n# An Example\n\nHere is a good example of what we can create as a flexdashboard based\nbusiness report:\n\n<https://testing-apps.shinyapps.io/flexdashboard-ggplotly-examples/>\n\nLet us work through creating a `flexdashboard` based report.\n\n## References\n\n1.
