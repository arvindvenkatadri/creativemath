Business analytics is\"a process of transforming data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision making and problem solving.\"<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Libertore and Luo, 2010 </div>\n\n<br> The Course starts with **Descriptive Analytics**: Datasets from various domains of Business enterprise and activity are introduced. The datasets are motivated from the point of view of the types of information they contain: students will relate the Data Variables (Qualitative and Quantitative) to various types of Data/Information Visualizations.\n\n**Statistical Concepts** such as ***Sampling, Hypothesis Tests, Simulation / Modelling, and Uncertainty*** will be introduced.\n\n**Predictive Analytics** will take us into looking at Data and training standard ML algorithms to make predictions with new Data. ***Regression, Clustering, and Classification*** will be covered.\n\n**Prescriptive Analytics** will deal with coming to terms with the uncertainty in Predictions, and using tools such as both ***ML, Linear/non-Linear Programming, and Decision-Making*** to make Business Decisions, with an assessment of the Risks involved.\n\nThe Course will culminate in a full **Business Analytics Workflow** that includes Data Gathering and Cleaning, Descriptive and Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Making, and Communication resulting in a publication-worthy documents.(HTML / PDF/ Word)\n\n## What you will learn\n\n-   **Data Basics**: What does data look like and why should we care?\n-   Rapidly and intuitively creating **Graphs and Data Visualizations** to explore data for insights\n-   Use **Statistical Tests, Procedures, Models, and Simulations** and to answer Business Questions\n-   Using **ML algorithms** such Regression, Classification, and Clustering to develop Business Insights\n-   Use **Linear Programming** to make Business Decisions\n-   Create crisp and readable **Reports** that can be shared in a Business Context\n\n## Texts\n\n1.
