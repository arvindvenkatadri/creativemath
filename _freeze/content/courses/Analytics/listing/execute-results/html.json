Business analytics is\"a process of transforming\n> data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of\n> organizational decision making and problem solving.\"\n>\n> ::: {style=\"text-align: right\"}\n> Libertore and Luo, 2010\n> :::\n\n<br> The Course starts with **Descriptive Analytics**: Datasets from\nvarious domains of Business enterprise and activity are introduced. The\ndatasets are motivated from the point of view of the types of\ninformation they contain: students will relate the Data Variables\n(Qualitative and Quantitative) to various types of Data/Information\nVisualizations.\n\n**Statistical Concepts** such as ***Sampling, Hypothesis Tests,\nSimulation / Modelling, and Uncertainty*** will be introduced.\n\n**Predictive Analytics** will take us into looking at Data and training\nstandard ML algorithms to make predictions with new Data. ***Regression,\nClustering, and Classification*** will be covered.\n\n**Prescriptive Analytics** will deal with coming to terms with the\nuncertainty in Predictions, and using tools such as both ***ML,\nLinear/non-Linear Programming, and Decision-Making*** to make Business\nDecisions, with an assessment of the Risks involved.\n\nThe Course will culminate in a full **Business Analytics Workflow** that\nincludes Data Gathering and Cleaning, Descriptive and Predictive\nAnalytics, Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Making, and Communication\nresulting in a publication-worthy documents.(HTML / PDF/ Word)\n\n## What you will learn\n\n-   **Data Basics**: What does data look like and why should we care?\n-   Rapidly and intuitively creating **Graphs and Data Visualizations**\n    to explore data for insights\n-   Use **Statistical Tests, Procedures, Models, and Simulations** and\n    to answer Business Questions\n-   Using **ML algorithms** such Regression, Classification, and\n    Clustering to develop Business Insights\n-   Use **Linear Programming** to make Business Decisions\n-   Create crisp and readable **Reports** that can be shared in a\n    Business Context\n\n## Texts\n\n1.
