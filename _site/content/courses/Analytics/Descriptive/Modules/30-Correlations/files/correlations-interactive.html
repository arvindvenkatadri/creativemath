<p>We will also start using <code>echarts4r</code> side by side for interactive graphs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every function in the package starts with <code>e_</code>.</li>
<li>You start coding a visualization by creating an echarts object with the <code>e_charts()</code> function. That takes your <code>data frame</code> and <code>x-axis column</code> as arguments.</li>
<li>Next, you add a function for the type of chart (<code>e_line()</code>, <code>e_bar()</code>, etc.) with the <code>y-axis series column name</code> as an argument.</li>
<li>The rest is mostly customization! <code>echarts4r</code> takes some effort in getting used to, but it totally worth it!</li>

<p>The <code>inspect</code> command already gives us a series of statistical measures of different variables of interest. As discussed previously, we can retain the output of <code>inspect</code> and use it in our reports: (there are ways of dressing up these tables too)</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The dataset is described as:</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">Try <code>help("Galton")</code> in your Console.</span></div></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A data frame with 898 observations on the following variables.<br>
- <code>family</code> a factor with levels for each family<br>
- <code>father</code> the father’s height (in inches)<br>
- <code>mother</code> the mother’s height (in inches)<br>
- <code>sex</code> the child’s sex: F or M<br>
- <code>height</code> the child’s height as an adult (in inches)<br>
- <code>nkids</code> the number of adult children in the family, or, at least, the number whose heights Galton recorded.</p>

<p>There is a lot of Description generated by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/mosaicCore/man/inspect.html">mosaic::inspect()</a></code> command ! What can we say about the dataset and its variables? How big is the dataset? How many variables? What types are they, Quant or Qual? If they are Qual, what are the <em>levels</em>? Are they <em>ordered</em> levels? Discuss!</p>

<p><strong>Insight</strong>: There are significant, but low value correlations in the <code>Galton</code> dataset. <code>height</code> is best correlated with <code>father</code> (<span class="math inline">\(0.275\)</span>). The Scatter Plots shown in the plot also visually demonstrate the (lack of) large value correlations.</p>
<p>We cannot have too many variables in this kind of plot. We will shortly see how to plot correlations when there are a large number of variables.</p>

<p>Note how the <code>cor.test</code> reports a correlation score and the <code>p-value</code> for the same. There is also a <code>confidence interval</code> reported for the correlation score, an interval within which we are 95% sure that the true correlation value is to be found. Note that <code>GGally</code> too reports the significance of the correlation scores using <code>***</code> or <code>**</code>. This indicates the p-value in the scores obtained by <code>GGally</code>; Presumably, there is an internal <code>cor.test</code> that is run for each pair of variables and the p-value and confidence levels are also computed internally.</p>
<p>We can also visualise this uncertainty and the confidence levels in a plot too, using <code>gf_errorbar</code> and a handy set of functions within <code>purrr</code> which is part of the tidyverse: Assuming <code>heights</code> is the <strong>target</strong> variable we want to correlate every other (quantitative) variable against, we can proceed very quickly as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Insight</strong>: We can clearly see the size of the correlations and the confidence intervals marked in this plot. <code>father</code> has somewhat greater correlation with children’s <code>height</code>, as compared to <code>mother</code>. <code>nkids</code> seems to matter very slightly, in a negative way.</p>
<p>This kind of plot will be very useful when we pursue <strong>linear regression models</strong>.</p>

<p>We have a decent Correlations related <em>workflow</em> in R:<br>
- load the dataset<br>
- <code>inspect</code> the dataset, identify Quant and Qual variables<br>
- Develop Pair-Wise plots + Correlations using <code><a href="https://ggobi.github.io/ggally/reference/ggpairs.html">GGally::ggpairs()</a></code><br>
- Develop Correlogram <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/corrplot/man/corrplot.html">corrplot::corrplot</a></code><br>
- Check everything with a <code>cor_test</code><br>
- Use <code>purrr</code> + <code>cor.test</code> to plot correlations and confidence intervals for multiple Quant variables<br>
- Plot scatter plots using <code>gf_point</code>.<br>
- Add extra lines using <code>gf_abline()</code> to compare hypotheses that you may have.</p>
