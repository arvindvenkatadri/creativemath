Let’s fetch a figure from the web to show the (preferred) structure of data in R.\n\n\nTidy Data\n\n\nThe three features described in the figure above define the nature of tidy data:\n\nVariables in Columns\n\nObservations in Rows and\n\nMeasurements in Cells.\n\nData are imagined to be resulting from an experiment. Each variable represents a parameter/aspect in the experiment. Each row represents an additional datum of measurement. A cell is a single measurement on a single parameter(column) in a single observation(row).\nWhen working with data you must:\n\nFigure out what you want to do. (Purpose)\nDescribe those tasks in the form of a computer program. (Plain English to R Code)\nExecute the program.\n\nThe dplyr package makes these steps fast and easy:\n\nBy constraining your options, it helps you think about your data manipulation challenges.\nIt provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code.\nIt uses efficient backends, so you spend less time waiting for the computer.\n\n\nNe’er you mind about backends ;-) See Shakespeare’s Hamlet.\n\nThis document introduces you to dplyr’s basic set of tools, and shows you how to apply them to data frames. dplyr also supports databases via the dbplyr package, once you’ve installed, read vignette(\"dbplyr\") to learn more."

    "title": "Introduction to the dplyr package",
    "section": "\n5 Single table verbs",
    "text": "5 Single table verbs\ndplyr aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These verbs can be organised into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with:\n\nRows:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\nslice() chooses rows based on location.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\n\nColumns:\n\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate() changes the values of columns and creates new columns.\n\nrelocate() changes the order of the columns.\n\n\nGroups of rows:\n\n\nsummarise() collapses a group into a single row.\n\n\n\n\nThink of the parallels from Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n5.1 The pipe\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame (or tibble) as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the %>% operator from magrittr. x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y) so the result from one step is then “piped” into the next step. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (reading the pipe operator as “then”).\n\n5.2 Filter rows with filter()\n\nfilter() allows you to select a subset of rows in a data frame. Like all single verbs, the first argument is the tibble (or data frame). The second and subsequent arguments refer to variables within that data frame, selecting rows where the expression is TRUE.\nFor example, we can select all character with light skin color and brown eyes with:\n\nNote the double equal to sign (==) below! Equivalent to MS Excel Data -> Filter\n\n\nstarwars %>% filter(skin_color == \"light\", eye_color == \"brown\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.3 Arrange rows with arrange()\n\narrange() works similarly to filter() except that instead of filtering or selecting rows, it reorders them. It takes a data frame, and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:\n\nstarwars %>% arrange(height, mass)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUse desc() to order a column in descending order:\n\nstarwars %>% arrange(desc(height))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.4 Choose rows using their position with slice()\n\nslice() lets you index rows by their (integer) locations. It allows you to select, remove, and duplicate rows.\n\nThis is an important step in Prediction, Modelling and Machine Learning.\n\nWe can get characters from row numbers 5 through 10.\n\nstarwars %>% slice(5:10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt is accompanied by a number of helpers for common use cases:\n\n\nslice_head() and slice_tail() select the first or last rows.\n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_head(n = 3)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nslice_sample() randomly selects rows. Use the option prop to choose a certain proportion of the cases.\n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_sample(prop = 0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUse replace = TRUE to perform a bootstrap sample. If needed, you can weight the sample with the weight argument.\n\nBootstrap samples are a special statistical sampling method. Counterintuitive perhaps, since you sample with replacement. Should remind you of your high school Permutation and Combination class, with all those urn models and so on. If you remember.\n\n\n\nslice_min() and slice_max() select rows with highest or lowest values of a variable. Note that we first must choose only the values which are not NA.\n\n\nstarwars %>%\n  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%\n  slice_min(height, n = 3)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.5 Select columns with select()\n\nOften you work with large datasets with many columns but only a few are actually of interest to you. select() allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations that usually only work on numeric variable positions:\n\n# Select columns by name\nstarwars %>% select(hair_color, skin_color, eye_color)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns between hair_color and eye_color (inclusive)\nstarwars %>% select(hair_color:eye_color)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns except those from hair_color to eye_color (inclusive)\nstarwars %>% select(!(hair_color:eye_color))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns ending with color\nstarwars %>% select(ends_with(\"color\"))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThere are a number of helper functions you can use within select(), like starts_with(), ends_with(), matches() and contains(). These let you quickly match larger blocks of variables that meet some criterion. See ?select for more details.\nYou can rename variables with select() by using named arguments:\n\nstarwars %>% select(home_world = homeworld)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBut because select() drops all the variables not explicitly mentioned, it’s not that useful. Instead, use rename():\n\nstarwars %>% rename(home_world = homeworld)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.6 Add new columns with mutate()\n\nBesides selecting sets of existing columns, it’s often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. This is the job of mutate():\n\nstarwars %>% mutate(height_m = height / 100)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can’t see the height in meters we just calculated, but we can fix that using a select command.\n\nstarwars %>%\n  mutate(height_m = height / 100) %>%\n  select(height_m, height, everything())\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\ndplyr::mutate() is similar to the base transform(), but allows you to refer to columns that you’ve just created:\n\nstarwars %>%\n  mutate(\n    height_m = height / 100,\n    BMI = mass / (height_m^2)\n  ) %>%\n  select(BMI, everything())\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute():\n\nstarwars %>%\n  transmute(\n    height_m = height / 100,\n    BMI = mass / (height_m^2)\n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.7 Change column order with relocate()\n\nUse a similar syntax as select() to move blocks of columns at once\n\nstarwars %>% relocate(sex:homeworld, .before = height)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.8 Summarise values with summarise()\n\nThe last verb is summarise(). It collapses a data frame to a single row.\n\nstarwars %>% summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt’s not that useful until we learn the group_by() verb below.\n\n5.9 Commonalities\nYou may have noticed that the syntax and function of all these verbs are very similar:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame.\nThe subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using $.\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nTogether these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result.\nThese five functions provide the basis of a language of data manipulation. At the most basic level, you can only alter a tidy data frame in five useful ways: you can reorder the rows (arrange()), pick observations and variables of interest (filter() and select()), add new variables that are functions of existing variables (mutate()), or collapse many values to a summary (summarise())."

This doesn’t lead to particularly elegant code, especially if you want to do many operations at once.

    "title": "Introduction to the dplyr package",
    "section": "\n7 Patterns of operations",
    "text": "7 Patterns of operations\nThe dplyr verbs can be classified by the type of operations they accomplish (we sometimes speak of their semantics, i.e., their meaning). It’s helpful to have a good grasp of the difference between select and mutate operations.\n\n7.1 Selecting operations\nOne of the appealing features of dplyr is that you can refer to columns from the tibble as if they were regular variables. However, the syntactic uniformity of referring to bare column names hides semantical differences across the verbs. A column symbol supplied to select() does not have the same meaning as the same symbol supplied to mutate().\nSelecting operations expect column names and positions. Hence, when you call select() with bare variable names, they actually represent their own positions in the tibble. The following calls are completely equivalent from dplyr’s point of view:\n\n# `name` represents the integer 1\nselect(starwars, name)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nselect(starwars, 1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBy the same token, this means that you cannot refer to variables from the surrounding context if they have the same name as one of the columns. In the following example, height still represents 2, not 5:\n\nheight <- 5\nselect(starwars, height)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOne useful subtlety is that this only applies to bare names and to selecting calls like c(height, mass) or height:mass. In all other cases, the columns of the data frame are not put in scope. This allows you to refer to contextual variables in selection helpers:\n\nname <- \"color\"\nselect(starwars, ends_with(name))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThese semantics are usually intuitive. But note the subtle difference:\n\nname <- 5\nselect(starwars, name, identity(name))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the first argument, name represents its own position 1. In the second argument, name is evaluated in the surrounding context and represents the fifth column.\n\n7.2 Mutating operations\nMutate semantics are quite different from selection semantics. Whereas select() expects column names or positions, mutate() expects column vectors. We will set up a smaller tibble to use for our examples.\n\ndf <- starwars %>% select(name, height, mass)\n\nWhen we use select(), the bare column names stand for their own positions in the tibble. For mutate() on the other hand, column symbols represent the actual column vectors stored in the tibble. Consider what happens if we give a string or a number to mutate():\n\nmutate(df, \"height\", 2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nmutate() gets length-1 vectors that it interprets as new columns in the data frame. These vectors are recycled so they match the number of rows. That’s why it doesn’t make sense to supply expressions like \"height\" + 10 to mutate(). This amounts to adding 10 to a string! The correct expression is:\n\nmutate(df, height + 10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the same way, you can unquote values from the context if these values represent a valid column. They must be either length 1 (they then get recycled) or have the same length as the number of rows. In the following example we create a new vector that we add to the data frame:\n\nvar <- seq(1, nrow(df))\nmutate(df, new = var)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nA case in point is group_by(). While you might think it has select semantics, it actually has mutate semantics. This is quite handy as it allows to group by a modified column:\n\ngroup_by(starwars, sex)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngroup_by(starwars, sex = as.factor(sex))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngroup_by(starwars, height_binned = cut(height, 3))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is why you can’t supply a column name to group_by(). This amounts to creating a new column containing the string recycled to the number of rows:\n\ngroup_by(df, \"month\")"

This is because the level of observation in our current moma dataset is unique paintings. We have multiple paintings done by the same artists though, so counting just the number of unique paintings is different than counting the number of unique artists.\nRemember how count can be used back-to-back to roll up a level of detail? Try running count(artist_gender) again on your last code chunk.\n\nmoma %>% \n  count(artist_gender, artist) %>% \n  count(artist_gender)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis output takes the previous table (made with count(artist_gender, artist)), and essentially ignores the n column. So we no longer care about how many paintings each individual artist created. Instead, we want to count the rows in this new table where each row is a unique artist. By counting by artist_gender in the last line, we are grouping by levels of that variable (so Female/Male/NA) and nn is the number of unique artists for each gender category recorded."

    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrier Seated\n\n\n\n\nThe Boston terrier breed originated around 1875, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston purchased from Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper’s Judge), which was of a bull and terrier type lineage. Hooper’s Judge is directly related to the original bull and terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper’s Judge as the ancestor of all true modern Boston Terriers. Judge weighed about 32 pounds (15 kg).\n\n\n\n\nJudge was bred to Burnett’s Gyp (or Kate). Gyp was a white bulldog-type female, owned by Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts. She weighed about 20 pounds (9.1 kg), was stocky and strong and had the typical blocky head now shown in Bostons. From this foundation of the breed, subsequent breeders refined the breed into its modern day presentation. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the bull and terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg) (Old Boston Bulldogs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA young male Boston Terrier with a Brown brindle coat\n\nThe breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed’s nickname, “roundheads”. Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog breed in the US.\nIn the early years, the color and markings were not very important to the breed’s standard. By the 20th century the breed’s distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. Boston University has used Rhett the Boston Terrier as their mascot since 1922. Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC has had a live Boston Terrier mascot named Blitz since 2003 that attends home football games. The Boston Terrier has also been the official state dog of Massachusetts since 1979."

    "text": "Description\nThe Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the tail is short. According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25 pounds (11 kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15–17 inches (380–430 mm) at the withers.\nThe American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds.\nCoat and color\nThe Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal (color of a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the bright sun), or a combination of the three. Any other color is not accepted as a Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually obtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its characteristic “tuxedo” appearance.6 Any Boston Terrier from AKC parentage regardless of the color, or if it is a splash or has a blue eye or weak ears, can be and are registered by the AKC and participate in any AKC sporting events.\n\n\n\nA female Boston Terrier with a black coat\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the Boston Terrier’s markings are broken down into two categories: Required, which consists of a white chest, white muzzle band, and a white band between the eyes; and Desired, which includes the Required markings plus a white collar, white on the forelegs, forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier’s markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as “the American Gentleman.”\n\n\n\nAn adult male Boston Terrier with a black coat"

Boston Terriers are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.\nWhile originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment factories, they were later bred for companionship. They are not considered terriers by the American Kennel Club, however, but are part of the non-sporting group.\nBoth females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary, Their usually sensible attitude toward barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets, if properly socialized."

    "text": "Grooming\nWith a short, shiny, smooth coat, Boston Terriers require little grooming. Bostons produce light shedding, and weekly brushing of their fine coat is effective at removing loose hair. Brushing promotes the health of the coat because it distributes skin oils, and it also encourages new hair growth. Occasional bathing is suitable for the breed.7\nThe nails of Boston Terriers require regular trimming. Overgrown nails not only have the potential to inflict pain on the breed, but they can also make walking difficult or tear off after getting snagged on something.\nSimilarly to nail trimming, tooth brushing should also be done regularly to promote good oral health. The risk of the breed developing oral pain, gum infection, or bad breath can be decreased with regular tooth brushing that removes plaque buildup and other bacteria. In addition, poor dental hygiene can lead to tooth root abscesses that can lead to damage around the tissue and eventually lead to the loss of teeth."

It handles different data types and returns a skim_df object which can be included in a pipeline or displayed nicely for the human reader.\n\n\npenguins %>% \n  group_by(species) %>% \n  skimr::skim() %>% \n  select(-contains(\"numeric.p\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n344\n\n\nNumber of columns\n8\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n2\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nspecies\n\n\n\nData summaryVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nspecies\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nordered\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\nisland\nAdelie\n0\n1.00\nFALSE\n3\nDre: 56, Tor: 52, Bis: 44\n\n\nisland\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\nFALSE\n1\nDre: 68, Bis: 0, Tor: 0\n\n\nisland\nGentoo\n0\n1.00\nFALSE\n1\nBis: 124, Dre: 0, Tor: 0\n\n\nsex\nAdelie\n6\n0.96\nFALSE\n2\nfem: 73, mal: 73\n\n\nsex\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\nFALSE\n2\nfem: 34, mal: 34\n\n\nsex\nGentoo\n5\n0.96\nFALSE\n2\nmal: 61, fem: 58\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nspecies\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\nhist\n\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nAdelie\n1\n0.99\n38.79\n2.66\n▁▆▇▆▁\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\n48.83\n3.34\n▂▇▇▅▁\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nGentoo\n1\n0.99\n47.50\n3.08\n▃▇▆▁▁\n\n\nbill_depth_mm\nAdelie\n1\n0.99\n18.35\n1.22\n▂▆▇▃▁\n\n\nbill_depth_mm\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\n18.42\n1.14\n▅▇▇▆▂\n\n\nbill_depth_mm\nGentoo\n1\n0.99\n14.98\n0.98\n▅▇▇▆▂\n\n\nflipper_length_mm\nAdelie\n1\n0.99\n189.95\n6.54\n▁▆▇▅▁\n\n\nflipper_length_mm\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\n195.82\n7.13\n▁▅▇▅▂\n\n\nflipper_length_mm\nGentoo\n1\n0.99\n217.19\n6.48\n▂▇▇▆▃\n\n\nbody_mass_g\nAdelie\n1\n0.99\n3700.66\n458.57\n▅▇▇▃▂\n\n\nbody_mass_g\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\n3733.09\n384.34\n▁▅▇▃▁\n\n\nbody_mass_g\nGentoo\n1\n0.99\n5076.02\n504.12\n▃▇▇▇▂\n\n\nyear\nAdelie\n0\n1.00\n2008.01\n0.82\n▇▁▇▁▇\n\n\nyear\nChinstrap\n0\n1.00\n2007.97\n0.86\n▇▁▆▁▇\n\n\nyear\nGentoo\n0\n1.00\n2008.08\n0.79\n▆▁▇▁▇\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific statistics\nWe can also explore specific statistics\nThe penguins split by species show a specific relationship between weight and flipper length, where the Adelie female penguins are the lighest and have the shortest flippers.\n\npenguins %>% \n  group_by(species, sex) %>% \n  summarize(\n    n = n(), \n    weight = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(weight))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'species'.

However, there is still a decent amount of overlapping data.\n\npenguin_plot <- smaller %>% \n  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + \n  geom_density(color = \"white\", alpha = 0.5) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Penguin Bins\")\n\npenguin_plot\n\n\n\n\nLastly we can fit a basic linear model comparing body weight in grams to the flipper length of the penguins by specific species. There is a strong linear relationship, although it’s a bit difficult to distinguish between Chinstrap and Adelie penguins.\n\npenguin_size_plot <- penguins_clean %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\",\"cyan4\")) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Mass (g)\", y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\") +\n  geom_smooth(aes(group = \"none\"), method = \"lm\")\n\npenguin_size_plot\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can save the overall distribution and the linear model plot.\n\nggsave(\"penguin-dist.png\", penguin_plot, \n  dpi = \"retina\", height = 8, width = 8)\n\nggsave(\"penguin-smooth.png\", penguin_size_plot, \n  dpi = \"retina\", height = 8, width = 8)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nModeling section\nMoving on to some basic modeling we can see if what kind of relationships we observe in the data. Note that I’m really not following any plan, just indicating how you can fit some different models all at once with dplyr + broom.\n\nmodel_inputs <- tibble(\n  model_form = c(\n    list(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g),\n    list(species_num ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex),\n    list(flipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species)\n    ),\n  data = list(penguins_clean)\n) \n\nmodel_metrics <- model_inputs %>% \n  rowwise(model_form, data) %>% \n  summarize(lm = list(lm(model_form, data = data)), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  rowwise(model_form, lm, data) %>% \n  summarise(broom::glance(lm), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nWrap up\nWe can then take the model outcomes and throw them into a quick gt table.\n\nmodel_metrics %>% \n  select(model_form, r.squared:p.value) %>% \n  mutate(model_form = as.character(model_form)) %>% \n  gt::gt() %>% \n  gt::fmt_number(r.squared:statistic) %>% \n  gt::fmt_scientific(p.value) %>% \n  gt::cols_width(\n    model_form ~ px(150)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_form\n      r.squared\n      adj.r.squared\n      sigma\n      statistic\n      p.value\n    \n\n\nflipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g\n0.76\n0.76\n6.85\n1,060.30\n3.13 × 10−105\n\n\n\nspecies_num ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex\n0.84\n0.84\n0.36\n583.59\n2.45 × 10−131\n\n\n\nflipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species\n0.83\n0.83\n5.83\n529.22\n1.66 × 10−125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this was a quick overview of the beauty of literate programming. We have R code that is self-documenting, as we capture our thoughts and the outputs in a single document. We know at some level that the code works since it “logs” the outputs at various stages and could still output to additional log files. To render it has to run successfully in a linear fashion, and it is human readable as code, via the visual editor or even in version control like Git!"

The default is pattern = \"{estimate} ({conf.level*100}% CI {conf.low}, {conf.high}; {p.value})\".

Age was not significantly associated with tumor response (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00, 1.04; p=0.091). If you’re printing results from a categorical variable, include the level argument, e.g. inline_text(tbl_m1, variable = stage, level = \"T3\") resolves to “0.94 (95% CI 0.39, 2.28; p=0.9)”.\n\nThe inline_text function has arguments for rounding the p-value (pvalue_fun) and the coefficients and confidence interval (estimate_fun). These default to the same rounding performed in the table, but can be modified when reporting inline.\nFor more details about inline code, review to the RStudio documentation page."

    "text": "The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. This style has been implemented in LaTeX and HTML/CSS1, respectively. We have ported both implementations into the tufte package. If you want LaTeX/PDF output, you may use the tufte_handout format for handouts, and tufte_book for books. For HTML output, use tufte_html. These formats can be either specified in the YAML metadata at the beginning of an R Markdown document (see an example below), or passed to the rmarkdown::render() function. See Allaire et al. (2022) for more information about rmarkdown.1 See Github repositories tufte-latex and tufte-css\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\noutput:\n  tufte::tufte_handout: default\n  tufte::tufte_html: default\n---\nThere are two goals of this package:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same R Markdown document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures, e.g. when you want a margin figure, all you need to do is the chunk option fig.margin = TRUE, and we will take care of the details for you, so you never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} \\end{marginfigure} or <span class=\"marginfigure\"> </span>; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.\n\nIf you have any feature requests or find bugs in tufte, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/rstudio/tufte/issues. For general questions, you may ask them on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/rmarkdown."

You can adjust the proportions of figures using the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin."

Unlike R code chunks ```{r}, you write a chunk starting with ```{marginfigure} instead, then put the content in the chunk. See an example on the right about the first fundamental theorem of calculus.\n\nWe know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{a}^{x} f(u)\\,du\\right)=f(x).$$\n\nFor the sake of portability between LaTeX and HTML, you should keep the margin content as simple as possible (syntax-wise) in the marginefigure blocks. You may use simple Markdown syntax like **bold** and _italic_ text, but please refrain from using footnotes, citations, or block-level elements (e.g. blockquotes and lists) there.\nNote: if you set echo = FALSE in your global chunk options, you will have to add echo = TRUE to the chunk to display a margin figure, for example ```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}."

    "text": "This is an attempt to rework , using tidygraph and ggraph, much of Network Visualization with R Polnet 2018 Workshop Tutorial, Washington, DC by Prof. Katherine (Katya) Ognyanova.\nThe aim is to get a working acquaintance with both these packages and also to appreciate some of the concepts in Networks. My code is by no means intended to be elegant; it merely works and there are surely many improvements that people may think of!\nI have attempted to write code for the Sections 2:5.\nI have retained Prof. Ognyanova’s text in all places."

21, size = 4)))\n\n\n\n\nWe can also override the attributes explicitly in the plot:\n\nplot(net, edge.color = \"orange\", vertex.color = \"gray50\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add a legend explaining the meaning of the colors we used:\n\nplot(net)\nlegend(x = -2.1, y = -1.1, \n       c(\"Newspaper\",\"Television\", \"Online News\"), \n       pch = 21,col = \"#777777\", \n       pt.bg = colrs, pt.cex = 2.5, bty = \"n\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n# legends are automatic with the tidygraph + ggraph flow\n\nSometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in plotting only the labels of the nodes:\n\nplot(net, vertex.shape = \"none\", vertex.label = V(net)$media,\n     vertex.label.font = 2, vertex.label.color = \"gray40\",\n     vertex.label.cex = .7, edge.color = \"gray85\")\n\n\n\n#using tidygraph\n\nggraph(net, layout = \"gem\") +\n  geom_edge_link(color = \"grey80\", width = 2,\n                 end_cap = circle(0.5,\"cm\"), \n                 start_cap = circle(0.5, \"cm\")) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(label = media))\n\n\n\n\nLet’s color the edges of the graph based on their source node color. We’ll get the starting node for each edge with ends().\nNote: Edge attribute is being set by start node.\n\nedge.start <- ends(net, es = E(net), names = F)[,1]\nedge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start] # How simple this is !!!\n# The three colors are recycled \n# \nplot(net, edge.color = edge.col, edge.curved = .4)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The source node colour has been set using the media.type, which is a node attribute. Node attributes are not typically accessible to edges. So we need to build a combo data frame using dplyr, so that edges can use this node attribute.

You can change that with the parameter rescale = FALSE and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar. You can use norm_coords to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want. This way you can create more compact or spread out layout versions.\n\n#Get the layout coordinates:\nl <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)\n# Normalize them so that they are in the -1, 1 interval:\nl <- norm_coords(l, ymin = -1, ymax = 1, xmin = -1, xmax = 1)\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(0,0,0,0))\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.4)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.8)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.2)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.6)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# Can't do this with tidygraph ( multiplying layout * scalar ), it seems\n\nAnother popular force-directed algorithm that produces nice results for connected graphs is Kamada Kawai. Like Fruchterman Reingold, it attempts to minimize the energy in a spring system.\n\nl <- layout_with_kk(net.bg)\nplot(net.bg, layout = l)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)\ngraph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_kk(.)) + \n  geom_edge_link0(colour = \"grey\") + \n  geom_node_point(colour = \"orange\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nThe MDS (multidimensional scaling) algorithm tries to place nodes based on some measure of similarity or distance between them. More similar/less distant nodes are placed closer to each other. By default, the measure used is based on the shortest paths between nodes in the network. That can be changed with the dist parameter.\n\nplot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_mds)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)\ngraph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_mds(.)) + \n  geom_edge_link0(colour = \"grey\") + \n  geom_node_point(colour = \"orange\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nThe LGL algorithm is for large connected graphs. Here you can specify a root- the node that will be placed in the middle of the layout.\n\nplot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_lgl)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)\ngraph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_lgl(.)) + \n  geom_edge_link0(colour = \"grey\") + \n  geom_node_point(colour = \"orange\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nBy default, igraph uses a layout called layout_nicely which selects an appropriate layout algorithm based on the properties of the graph. Check out all available layouts in igraph:\n\n?igraph::layout_\n\n\nlayouts <- grep(\"^layout_\", ls(\"package:igraph\"), value = TRUE)[-1]\n\n# Remove layouts that do not apply to our graph.\nlayouts <- layouts[!grepl(\"bipartite|merge|norm|sugiyama|tree\", layouts)]\n\npar(mfrow = c(3,3), mar = c(1,1,1,1))\n\nfor (layout in layouts) {\n  print(layout)\n  l <- do.call(layout, list(net))\n  plot(net, edge.arrow.mode = 0, layout = l, main = layout) }\n\n[1] \"layout_as_star\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_components\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_in_circle\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_nicely\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_on_grid\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_on_sphere\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_randomly\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_dh\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_drl\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_fr\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_gem\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_graphopt\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_kk\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_lgl\"\n\n\n[1] \"layout_with_mds\""

    "text": "5. Plotting multiplex networks\nIn some cases, the networks we want to plot are multigraphs: they can have multiple edges connecting the same two nodes. A related concept, multiplex networks, contain multiple types of ties – e.g. friendship, romantic, and work relationships between individuals.\nIn our example network, we also have two tie types: hyperlinks and mentions. One thing we can do is plot each type of tie separately:\n\nE(net)$width <- 2\nplot(\n  net,\n  edge.color = c(\"dark red\", \"slategrey\")[(E(net)$type == \"hyperlink\") +\n                                            1],\n  vertex.color = \"gray40\",\n  layout = layout_in_circle,\n  edge.curved = .3\n)\n\n\n\n# Another way to delete edges using the minus operator:\nnet.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == \"hyperlink\"]\nnet.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == \"mention\"]\n\n#Plot the two links separately:\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nplot(net.h,\n     vertex.color = \"orange\",\n     layout = layout_with_fr,\n     main = \"Tie: Hyperlink\")\nplot(net.m,\n     vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue2\",\n     layout = layout_with_fr,\n     main = \"Tie: Mention\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the nodes stay in the same place in both plots:\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 4, 1))\n\nl <- layout_with_fr(net)\nplot(net.h,\n     vertex.color = \"orange\",\n     layout = l,\n     main = \"Tie: Hyperlink\")\nplot(net.m,\n     vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue2\",\n     layout = l,\n     main = \"Tie: Mention\")\n\n\n\n\n\n#Using tidygraph\n\nlayout <- layout_in_circle(net)\np1 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  filter(type == \"hyperlink\") %>% \n  \n  # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"orange\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Hyperlink\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\np2 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  filter(type == \"mention\") %>% \n   # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"lightsteelblue2\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Mention\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nwrap_plots(p1, p2,guides = \"collect\") & \n  # note this \"pipe\" for patchwork!\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nIn our example network, we don’t have node dyads connected by multiple types of connections (we never have both a ‘hyperlink’ and a ‘mention’ tie between the same two news outlets) – however that could happen.\nNote: See the edges between s03 and s10…these are in opposite directions. So no dyads.\n\nlayout <- layout_in_circle(net)\ntbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>%  \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n\n  # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05, aes(colour = type)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"orange\") +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), repel = TRUE) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Hyperlink\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nOne challenge in visualizing multiplex networks is that multiple edges between the same two nodes may get plotted on top of each other in a way that makes them impossible to distinguish. For example, let us generate a simple multiplex network with two nodes and three ties between them:\n\nmultigtr <- graph(edges = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), n = 2)\n\nl <- layout_with_kk(multigtr)\n\n# Let's just plot the graph:\nplot(\n  multigtr,\n  vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue\",\n  vertex.frame.color = \"white\",\n  vertex.size = 40,\n  vertex.shape = \"circle\",\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.color = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\"),\n  edge.width = 10,\n  edge.arrow.size = 5,\n  edge.curved = 0.1,\n  layout = l\n)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\nmultigtr %>% \n  as_tbl_graph() %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  mutate(edge_col = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\")) %>% \nggraph(., layout = l) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col)) + \n  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = \"lightsteelblue\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nBecause all edges in the graph have the same curvature, they are drawn over each other so that we only see the last one. What we can do is assign each edge a different curvature. One useful function in ‘igraph’ called curve_multiple() can help us here. For a graph G, curve.multiple(G) will generate a curvature for each edge that maximizes visibility.\n\nplot(\n  multigtr,\n  vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue\",\n  vertex.frame.color = \"white\",\n  vertex.size = 40,\n  vertex.shape = \"circle\",\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.color = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\"),\n  edge.width = 10,\n  edge.arrow.size = 5,\n  edge.curved = curve_multiple(multigtr),\n  layout = l\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nmultigtr %>% \n  as_tbl_graph() %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  mutate(edge_col = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\")) %>% \nggraph(., layout = l) +\n  geom_edge_fan(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col),width = 2) + \n  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = \"lightsteelblue\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is the end of this reoworked tutorial!

    "text": "Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary\nThe movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast includes Peter O’Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden, and Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The editing of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. (https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/)\nLawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely well read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an expert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to his being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a lowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General that Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what kind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.\nHere is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this time.11 I was not able to ascertain who is the author of this map. I would be happy to write to obtain permission and use it with acknowledgement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the way to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct experience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a Harith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily rejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi Safra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears the camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid by Turkish airplanes.\nLater in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to retreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where the British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the Turks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the British navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there. Brighton simply scoffs at that idea, because the Turkish have 12 inch guns at Aqaba and the British have other things to do.\nLawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the Koran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the meeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to his intentions in Arabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own interpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not necessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is not in favour of the Arab Army’s retreat to Yenbo, as it would become one small part of the British Army. As a parting remark, Feisal says to Lawrence that the Arabs need what no man can provide, a miracle.\nHere is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene."

    "text": "Lawrence’s Problem\nLawrence does not sleep that night. Provoked by Feisal’s parting remark, he sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about how Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting from where they were, and even advance if possible with British help. His detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of the Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba is a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai Peninsula.\nIn the early morning, seemingly in a eureka moment, he decides that attacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since the guns there could not be turned around.\nHere is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:\n\n\n\n\nLawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is Ali who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not consider Brighton as a member of his Field (as defined by Csikszentmihalyi in his Creativity Systems Model), but Feisal is a Field Member to Ali.\nApropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation and Elaboration stages of the 5 Stages of Creativity from Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration, Execution)."

    "section": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba",
    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as follows:\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k), we identify knobs or parameters within the situation and see how turning these could lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram for this purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if the British allies attack Aqaba, they may win, BUT they may lose a few warships. If the Arabs want to attack, they are too small in number and have no warships, and hence their chances of success are very slim. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take Aqaba without losing British ships.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define the Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the big guns there should have no effect.\n\n\nNote how the tone of this IFR is like a “eat my cake and have it too”. Very typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC). We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways2:2 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Increase Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12) and not worsen Stability of Objects Composition (21)- TC 2: Increase Stability of Objects Composition (21) and not worsen Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba should not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Power(18) or Illumination Intensity(23) to “metaphorize” the effectiveness of the attack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could even stretch to making a Physical Contradiction(PC)3 happen:3 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same time)"

    "section": "Solving the Technical Contradiction",
    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 24 (Intermediary)\n\nIP 40 (Composite Materials)\n\nand (TC2)\n\nIP 10 (Preliminary Action)\n\nIP 5 (Merging)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nHow are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an imaginative exercise as we map these Generalized Solutions back into the Problem at hand:\n\nIP 13: The Other Way Around. How? Not attack by sea? Wait…ATTACK BY LAND!! Change the DIRECTION of Attack! So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too). Will this work? Yes, the guns can’t turn around !!\nIP 35: Parameter Change. But “ships” on land?? Note, the desert is an ocean into which no oar is dipped. Sand and Water are both Resources in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy are being substituted with the use of ….Camels!! And, metaphorically speaking, it is still an attack using ships….The Ships of the Desert!! Parameter Change.\nIP 10: Prior Action. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba and cannot do anything “in advance”. What could this be?\nIP 5: Merging. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali must recruit the Howeitat tribe “in advance” of their attack !! As Lawrence tells Ali, If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they might be 50 men other men would join. This is in accordance with what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, in advance of the attack.\nIP 40: Composite Materials. What object within the situation can we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British Army…so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite into one composite army.\nAnd, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a composite force with camels…\n\nSo IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a camel-borne attack from the landward side. IP 10 also teams up with IP 40 and IP 5 to give the idea of tribe unification.\nAnd so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba port from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and take it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!\nHere is the final solution in action !!\n\n\n\n\n I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up !!"

It is he who has the problem and he who is going to apply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including the formulation of the Contradiction, Identification of Causes, the statement of the Ideal Final Result, and finally using the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix to find Inventive Principles, that lead to the solution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !\nFirst a philosophical digression:—\nSeveral authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse’s famous book titled Finite and Infinite Games speaks of Play, Types of Games, Rules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar articulation is, in my opinion, that of Mihaly Csikszentlmihalyi in his concept of Flow, shown here below:\n\n\nFrom Sketchplanations\n\n\nWhen the Game presents very little Challenge, we are bored. When the Game demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we experience anxiety. When the Challenge presented is just barely matched by our Skill, we are in the zone of Flow, or what I call Play.\nA good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:— that we live in a space where the Floor of Boredom is always rising and would crush us against our Ceiling of Anxiety. One Way to deal with this is to develop more Skills and push the Ceiling away, effectively moving into the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse suggests: When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.\nSo what does all this have to do with getting veggies?\nThe ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And not offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, “YM”) simply has to accompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will exaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young people likely to read this, and say that he would rather not be there but he does not want to hurt Mom.\nWe are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!"

If he doesn’t go, then he chills at home, but Mom is going to justifiably furious. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the Waste of Time, and being bored, and Stress at being away from friends.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The YM must go to the Market and not be bored.\n\n\nNote again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs practice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of Six Impossible Things before Breakfast ! Also note there could be other ways of specifying the IFR. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways1:1 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Improve Loss of Time (26) and not worsen Effect of External Harmful Factors (30)\n- TC 2: Improve Increase Productivity (44) and not worsen Stress (19)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the Market may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Noise(29) as the “metaphoric thing” to avoid, but the current IFR doesn’t quite support that. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:2 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The YM must be in the market and not be in the market at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed squarely at one of the Assumptions in the Problem, that the YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nIn a future post, we will deal with using the PC and the TRIZ Separation Principles to solve Problems."

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation\nWe see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement / Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nRe-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power consumption centers are the urban areas and these are far away from the generation sites. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these costs.\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around the home? Here below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that some these may sound very naive, but that is way to start!\n\nI would like to have access the the OWind but it needs to be not too close to the walls for it to harness the wind?\nHow to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection wires get twisted? ( (Do I need a [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric)) like arrangement?)\n\nas an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: We wish to pull out plastics from the river without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational / transportation )\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR:The River must flow. The Plastics must not.\n\n\nShort and pithy.\nWe could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our focus was. (Our focus here is the river). The way we would look at the Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case. More on this in just a bit!\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZContradictionMatrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways1:1 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Increase Volume of Stationary Object(8) and not worsen Harmful effects acting on the system(40)\n- TC 2: Improve Harmful effects acting on the system(40) and not worsen Volume of Stationary Object(8)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects that we choose the make the river our focus. We want to increase the volume of the stationary plastic in the river, while not worsening the harmful effects acting on the river. Note how the IFR is included here, in using the word stationary for the object: the plastic must not flow, while the river must.\nAs stated in my previous articles ( Lawrence of Arabia and Spotify), there is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, using the language of TRIZ, the 48 Parameters in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Amount of Substance (10) i.e. the plastic on the river, as the “metaphoric thing” to improve but the current IFR speaks of the river. Or we could choose Aesthetics and Appearance (39) as our target, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed manner. TRIZ tends to focus our attention like no other method that I know of.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:2 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC."

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below; The square for solutions to TC-1 has been circled in red.\n\nHere is what the Matrix suggests:\nFor TC-1:\n\n39(Inert Atmosphere)\n24(Intermediary)\n19(Periodic Action)\n\n27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (!!)\nand with TC-2:\n\n5(Merging)\n17(Another Dimension)\n39(Inert Atmosphere)\n19(Periodic Action)\n\nThis is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions we try to map these back into the Problem at hand:\n\n\n(39)Inert Atmosphere: Hmm…what can be inert in the River? What could “inert” mean here? The River should be inert…so must not flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!\n\n24(Intermediary): OK, something between the River and the Plastic. But…we don’t want nets or dams or weirs…then what? Need to think!!\n\n19(Periodic Action): What can be “periodic” in the River? Waves? But how do we make waves? Need to think some more!!\n\n27(Cheap Short Living Objects): What can be cheap short and short living in the River water? Not fish, surely…wait, BUBBLES!!!\n\nSo (breathlessly): we create bubbles in the water and use them as an Intermediary to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we want it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both Inert and Atmosphere, literally! And they are Cheap and Short-Lived so we need to regenerate them Periodically! We can periodically sweep the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb any other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!\n5(Merging) is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect. 17(Another Dimension) is also evocative and powerful as a Solution: the River flows horizontally but the barrier we need to create is vertical. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles dissolve in the River water (assuming another dimension, as it were) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains do!!\nSo there you have it! It seems that Going Dutch even with bubbles, is a good idea !"

    "text": "Using TRIZ Separation Principles\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying physical parameter, such as length, breadth, weight, or energy, or speed for example that lies at the root of our Technical Contradiction.\nOur IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to flow at the same time. But the Plastics are in the River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!\nCan we make the River “less of a River” in places? Can we make separate zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to harvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as (39)Inert Atmosphere and 24(Intermediary) suggest such a “spatial” separation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a Physical Contradiction related to “time”. TRIZ offers us a smaller and more easily “memorizable” set of metaphoric solutions in the form of Separation Principles. Here they are:\n\nSeparation in Time\nSeparation in Space\nSeparation on Condition\nSeparation between Parts and the Whole\n\nNote that while these Separation Principles are just a handful to memorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway. But then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles in the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew to a particular kind of Separation Principle.\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ, please send me a DM! Thanks !"

Each variable represents a parameter/aspect in the experiment. Each row represents an additional datum of measurement.

    "text": "8 Using {ggtext}\n\nFrom Claus Wilke’s website (www.wilkelab.org/ggtext)\n\nThe ggtext package provides simple Markdown and HTML rendering for ggplot2. Under the hood, the package uses the gridtext package for the actual rendering, and consequently it is limited to the feature set provided by gridtext.\nSupport is provided for Markdown both in theme elements (plot titles, subtitles, captions, axis labels, legends, etc.) and in geoms (similar to geom_text()). In both cases, there are two alternatives, one for creating simple text labels and one for creating text boxes with word wrapping.\n\nNOTE: on some machines, the ggtext package may not work as expected. In this case, please do as follows, using your Console:\n\nremove gridtext: remove.packages(gridtext).\nInstall development version of gridtext: remotes::install_github(\"wilkelab/gridtext\")\n\n\n\n8.1 element_markdown()\n\nWe can use our familiar markdown syntax right inside the titles and captions of the plot. element_markdown() is a theming command made available by the ggtext package.\nelement_markdown() → formatted text elements, e.g. titles, caption, axis text, strip text\n\n## assign plot to `gt` - we can add new things to this plot later\n## (wrapped in parenthesis so it is assigned and plotted in one step)\n\n(gt <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                            y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    \n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) +\n    \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 3:6 * 10, limits = c(30, 60)) +\n    \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(12.5, 22.5, by = 2.5), \n                     limits = c(12.5, 22.5)) +\n    \n  scico::scale_color_scico(palette = \"bamako\", direction = -1) +\n   \n# New code starts here: Two Step Procedure with ggtext\n# 1. Markdown formatting of labels and title, using asterisks\n# To create italics and bold text in titles\n    \n    \n  labs(\n    title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins (*Pygoscelis*)',\n    subtitle = 'A scatter plot of bill depth versus bill length.',\n    caption = 'Data: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) *PLoS ONE*',\n    \n    x = '**Bill Length** (mm)', \n    y = '**Bill Depth** (mm)',\n    \n    color = 'Body mass (g)'\n  ) +\n   \n  ## 2. Add theme related commands from ggtext\n  ## render respective text elements\n    \n  theme(\n    plot.title = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n    plot.caption = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n    axis.title.x = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n    axis.title.y = ggtext::element_markdown()\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 element_markdown() in combination with HTML\nThis allows us to change fonts in titles, labels, and captions:\n\n## use HTML syntax to change text color\ngt_mar <- gt +\n  labs(title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins <i style=\"color:#28A87D;\">Pygoscelis</i>') +\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 25))\n\n\n## use HTML syntax to change font and text size\ngt_mar +\n  labs(title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins <b style=\"font-size:32pt;font-family:tangerine;\">Pygoscelis</b>')\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Adding images to ggplot\nSave an image from the web in the same folder as your RMarkdown. Use html tags to include it, say as part of your plot title, as shown below.\n\n## use HTML syntax to add images to text elements\ngt_mar + \n  labs(title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"images/culmen_depth.png\"‚ width=\"480\"/>')\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Annotations with geom_richtext() and geom_textbox()\n\nFurther ggplot annotations can be achieved using geom_richtext() and geom_textbox().\ngeom_richtext() also allows formatted text labels with 360° rotation. One needs to pass a dataframe to geom_richtext() giving the location, colour, rotation etc of the label annotation.\n\ngt_rich <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) + \n  \n  ##

    "text": "9 Using {ggforce}\n\nFrom Thomas Lin Pedersen’s website → www.ggforce.data-imaginist.com\n\nggforce is a package aimed at providing missing functionality to ggplot2 through the extension system introduced with ggplot2 v2.0.0. Broadly speaking ggplot2 has been aimed primarily at explorative data visualization in order to investigate the data at hand, and less at providing utilities for composing custom plots a la D3.js. ggforce is mainly an attempt to address these “shortcoming” (design choices might be a better description). The goal is to provide a repository of geoms, stats, etc. that are as well documented and implemented as the official ones found in ggplot2.\n\nWe will start with the basic plot, with the ggtext related work done up to now:\n\n## use ggtext rendering for the following plots\ntheme_update(\n  plot.title = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  plot.caption = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  axis.title.x = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  axis.title.y = ggtext::element_markdown()\n)\n\n\n## plot that we will annotate with ggforce afterwards\n(gf <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + \n  scico::scale_color_scico(palette = \"bamako\", direction = -1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(25, 65), ylim = c(10, 25)) +\n  rcartocolor::scale_fill_carto_d(palette = \"Bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins (*Pygoscelis*)\",\n    subtitle = 'A scatter plot of bill depth versus bill length.',\n    caption = \"Data: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) *PLoS ONE*\",\n    x = \"**Bill Length** (mm)\", \n    y = \"**Bill Depth** (mm)\",\n    color = \"Body mass (g)\",\n    fill = \"Species\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n## ellipsoids for all groups\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_ellipse(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species), \n    alpha = .15, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic in this geom was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` in the `default_aes` field and elsewhere instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ellipsoids for specific subset\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_ellipse(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n#   coord_cartesian(xlim = c(25, 65), ylim = c(10, 25))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n## circles\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_circle(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n## rectangles\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_rect(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(concaveman)\n## hull\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_hull(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)"
